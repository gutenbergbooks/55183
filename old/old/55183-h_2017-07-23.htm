<span class="subhead">PALM ISLAND</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> sky from sea-line to sea-line was crusted with
stars, a triumphant, cloudless, tropic night-sky beneath
which the <i>Dryad</i> rode at her anchor, lifting lazily
to the swell flowing up from beyond the great Bahama
bank.</p>

<p>She was Skelton’s boat, a six-hundred-tonner, turbine
engined, rigged with everything new in the way of sea
valves and patent gadgets, and she had anchored at sundown
off Palm Island, a tiny spot, gull haunted, and
due west of Andros.</p>

<p>Skelton was a Christchurch man, Bobby Ratcliffe a
Brazenose, and Bobby, tonight, as he leaned on the starboard
rail smoking and listening to the wash of the
waves on the island beach, was thinking of Skelton, who
was down below writing up his diary. Before coming
on this “winter cruise to the West Indies in my yacht”
Bobby did not know that Skelton kept a diary, that Skelton
was so awfully Anglican, so precise, so stuffed with
the convenances, that he dined in dress clothes even in
a hurricane, that he had a very nasty, naggling temper,
that he had prayers every Sunday morning in the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
which the chief steward, the under stewards, and the
officers off watch were expected to attend—also Bobby.
Two other men were booked for the cruise, but they
cried off at the last moment. If they had come, things
might have been different. As it was, Bobby, to use his
own language, was pretty much fed up.</p>

<p>Skelton was a right good sort, but he was not the man
with whom to share loneliness, and Bobby, who had
plenty of money of his own, was thinking how jolly this
winter cruise would have been if he had only taken it on
board a passenger liner, with girls and deck quoits and
cards in the evening, instead of Skelton.</p>

<p>Bobby was only twenty-two, a good-looking clean
youth, well-balanced enough, but desirous of fun. Oxford
had not spoiled him a bit. He had no “manner,”—just
his own naturalness,—and he had shocked Skelton
at Barbados by getting a great negro washing woman
on board (she had come alongside in a blue boat) and
giving her rum, for the fun of the thing. “Debauching a
native woman with alcohol!” Skelton had called it.</p>

<p>Skelton vetoed shark fishing. It messed his decks.
He was like an old woman about his decks. “I tell you
what you ought to do, Skelly,” Bobby had said. “You
ought to start a blessed laundry!” They had nearly
quarreled at Guadeloupe over sharks.</p>

<p>And again at St. Pierre, where, lying off the ruins of
the town, Skelton had likened it to Gomorrah, declaring
it had been destroyed because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>“And how about the ships in the bay?” had asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Bobby. “What had they to do with the business? Why
weren’t they given notice to quit?”</p>

<p>“We won’t argue on the matter,” replied Skelton.</p>

<p>And there was still two months of this blessed cruise
to be worked out!</p>

<p>He was thinking of this when Skelton came on deck,
his white shirt-front shining in the starlight. He was in
an amiable mood tonight and, ranging up beside Bobby,
he spoke about the beauty of the stars.</p>

<p>It was chiefly on Bobby’s initiative that they had
dropped the anchor so that they might prospect the island
on the morrow, and as they smoked and talked the
conversation passed from stars to desert islands, and
from desert islands to the old Spaniards of the West
Indies, bucaneers, filibusters, pirates, and Brethren of
the Coast.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the starlight, or the tepid wind blowing
up from the straits of Florida, or the distant starlit
palms of Palm Island that set Skelton off and touched
a vein in his nature hitherto unsuspected: whatever it
was, he warmed to his subject and for the first time on
the voyage became interesting. He could talk! Nombre
de Dios, Carthagena, and Porto Bello,—he touched them
alive again, set the old plate-ships sailing and the pirates
overhauling them, sacked cathedrals of gold and jewels,
showed Bobby Tortuga, the great rendezvous of the
bucaneers and the Spaniards attacking it, men marooned
on desolate places like Palm Island, treasure buried—and
then all of a sudden closed up and became uninteresting
again. The remnants of the boy in him had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
spoken, the old pirate that lives in most men’s hearts
had shown his head. Perhaps he was ashamed of his
warmth and enthusiasm over these old romantic things—who
knows? At all events, he retired into himself and
then went below to find a book he was reading, leaving
the deck to Bobby and the anchor watch.</p>

<p>Then the moon began to rise from beyond the Bahamas,
a vast, full moon, with the sea seeming to cling to her
lower limb as she freed herself. Dusky, at first, she
paled as she rose, and now, in her light, the palms of
the island and the coral beach showed clear.</p>

<p>Palm Island is a scrub of cactus and bay cedar bushes,
half a mile long and quarter of a mile broad, with not
more than forty trees. Crabs and turtles and gulls are
its only visitors, and desolation sits there visible and
naked. But in the moonlight, on a night like this and
seen from the sea, it is fairyland—storyland.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, his mind full of pirates and bucaneers,
Spaniards and plate-ships, found himself wondering if
men had ever been marooned here, if Morgan and Van
Horn and all that crowd had ever had dealings on that
beach, and what the moon could tell about it all if she
could remember and speak. He was thinking this when
the creak of block and cordage struck his ear, and past
the stern of the <i>Dryad</i> came gliding the fore canvas of
a small vessel, a thing that seemed no larger than a
fishing boat.</p>

<p>She had been creeping in from the sea unnoticed by
them as they talked. Skelton had gone below without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
sighting her, and she was so close that the slap of her
bow-wash came clearly as she passed.</p>

<p>He watched her gliding shoreward like a phantom, and
then across the water came a voice, shrill as the voice of
a bird:</p>

<p>“Seven fathom!”</p>

<p>And on top of that another voice:</p>

<p>“Let go!”</p>

<p>The rumble—tumble—tumble—of an anchor chain followed,
and then the silence of the night closed in, broken
only by the far-off wash of the waves on the beach.</p>

<p>This ghost of the sea fascinated Ratcliffe. He could
see her now riding at anchor against the palms and bay
cedars of the island.</p>

<p>She was shedding her canvas; and now a glow-worm
spark, golden in the silver of the moonlight, climbed up
and became stationary but for the lift and fall of the
swell as she rode at her moorings. It was her anchor
light.</p>

<p>He listened for voices. None came. Then he saw a
lantern being carried along her deck. It vanished, probably
through a hatch.</p>

<p>Then he went below, and, dropping asleep the instant
he turned in, dreamt that he was marooned on Palm Island
with Skelton, and Skelton was trying to hang him
on a palm tree for a pirate, and the gulls were shouting
“Seven fathom!—seven fathom—seven fathom!” Then
came oblivion and the sleep of youth that defies dreams.</p>

<span class="subhead">A FLOATING CARAVAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Next</span> morning, an hour after sunrise, Ratcliffe came
on deck in his pajamas,—gorgeous blue and crimson
striped pajamas,—a sight for the gods.</p>

<p>The sky was cloudless. The wind of the night before
had fallen to a tepid breathing scarcely sufficient to stir
the flag at the jackstaff, and from all that world of new-born
blue and mirror-calm sea there came not a sound
but the sound of the gulls crying and quarreling about
the reef spurs of the island.</p>

<p>Amid the glory of light and color and against the
palms and white beach lay the ghost of the night before,
a frowzy-looking yawl-rigged boat of fifty feet or so, a
true hobo of the sea, with wear and weather written
all over her and an indescribable something that marked
her down even to Ratcliffe as disreputable.</p>

<p>Simmons, the second officer, was on deck.</p>

<p>“She must have come in last night,” said Simmons.
“Some sea scraper or another working between the islands—Spanish
most likely.”</p>

<p>“No, she’s not Spanish,” said Ratcliffe. “I saw her
come in and I heard them shouting the soundings in English—look!
there’s a chap fishing from her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
The flash of a fish being hauled on board had caught
his eye and fired his passion for sport. They had done
no fishing from the <i>Dryad</i>.</p>

<p>He borrowed the dinghy from Simmons and, just as
he was, put off.</p>

<p>“Ask them to sell some of their fish, if they’ve any to
spare,” cried Simmons as the dinghy got away.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay!” replied Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>The sea blaze almost blinded him as he rowed with
the gulls flying round and shouting at him. As he drew
up to the yawl the fisherman lugged another fish on
board. The fisherman was a boy, a dirty-faced boy, in
a guernsey, and as the dinghy came alongside he stared
at the pajama-clad one as at an apparition.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there!” cried Ratcliffe, clawing on with the
boathook.</p>

<p>“Hullo, yourself!” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Any fish for sale?”</p>

<p>“Any what?”</p>

<p>“Fish.”</p>

<p>The boy disappeared. Then came his voice, evidently
shouting down a hatch.</p>

<p>“Satan, below there!”</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Here’s the funniest guy come alongside wants to know
if we’ve got fish to sell him. Show a leg!”</p>

<p>“One minute,” replied the second voice.</p>

<p>The boy reappeared at the rail in the burning sunlight.
“The cap will be up in a minute,” said he. “What in the
nation are you got up like that for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
“What?”</p>

<p>“Them things.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe laughed.</p>

<p>“I forgot I was in my pajamas. I must apologize.”</p>

<p>“What’s pajamas?”</p>

<p>“My sleeping suit.”</p>

<p>“You sleep in them things?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” said the boy. Then he gave a
sudden yell of laughter and vanished, sitting down on the
deck evidently, while another form appeared at the rail,
a lantern-jawed, long-haired, youthful figure, rubbing
the sleep out of its eyes. It stared at the occupant of the
dinghy, then it opened its mouth and uttered one word:</p>

<p>“Moses!”</p>

<p>“He sleeps in them things!” came a half-strangled voice
from the deck. “Satan, hold me up, I’m dyin’!”</p>

<p>“Shut your beastly head!” said Satan. Then to Ratcliffe,
“Don’t be minding Jude,—Jude’s cracked,—but
you sure are gotten up—Say, you from that hooker
over there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What are you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>Another explosion from the deck, stifled by a kick from
Satan.</p>

<p>“But what are you doing here, anyway?”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe explained, Satan leaning comfortably on the
rail and listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
“A yacht—well, we’re the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>. Pap and me
and Jude used to run the boat. He died last fall. Tyler
was his name, and Satan Tyler’s mine. He said I
yelled like Satan when a pup and he put the name on
me—Say, that’s a dandy boat. I’m wanting a boat like
that. Will you trade?”</p>

<p>“She’s not mine.”</p>

<p>“That don’t matter,” said Tyler with a laugh. “But
I forgot: you aren’t in our way of business.”</p>

<p>“What’s your way of business?”</p>

<p>“Lord! Shut up, Satan!” came the voice from the
deck.</p>

<p>“Well, Pap was one thing or another; but we’re respectable,
ain’t we, Jude?”</p>

<p>“Passons to what Pap was,” agreed the voice in a
quieter tone, and it came to Ratcliffe that the figure of
Jude remained invisible, being ashamed to show itself
after having guyed him.</p>

<p>“We’re out of Havana, and we scratch round and
make a living,” went on Tyler, “and the boat being ours
we make out. There’s lots to be had on these seas for
the looking.”</p>

<p>“Do you work the boat alone?”</p>

<p>“Well, we had a nigger to help since Pap died. He
skipped at Pine Island a fortnight ago. Since then we’ve
made out. Jude’s worth a man and don’t drink—”</p>

<p>“Who says I don’t drink?” Two grimy hands seized
the rail and the body and face of Jude raised themselves.
Then the whole apparition hung, resting midriff high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
across the rail, just balanced, so that a tip from behind
would have sent it over.</p>

<p>“Who says I don’t drink? How about Havana Harbor
last trip?”</p>

<p>“They gave her rum,” said Satan gloomily, “gave her
rum in a doggery down by the waterside—curse the
swabs! I laid two of them flat and then got her
aboard.”</p>

<p>“Her!” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Blind, wasn’t I?” cut in Jude hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Blind you were,” said Tyler.</p>

<p>Jude grinned. Ratcliffe thought he had never met with
a stranger couple than these two, especially Jude. Hanging
on with the boathook, he contemplated the dirty, daring
face whose fine, gray, long-lashed eyes were the best
features.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” asked he, addressing it.</p>

<p>“Hundred an’ one,” said Jude. “Ask me another.”</p>

<p>“She’s fifteen and a bit,” said Tyler, “and as strong
as a grown man.”</p>

<p>“I thought she was a boy,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“So I am,” said Jude. “Girls is trash. I’m not never
goin’ to be a girl. Girls is snots!”</p>

<p>As if to prove her boyhood, she hung over the rail
so that he feared any moment she might tumble.</p>

<p>“She’s a girl, right enough,” said Tyler as if they were
discussing an animal, “but God help the skirts she ever
gets into!”</p>

<p>“I’d pull them over me head and run down the
street if anyone ever stuck skirts on me,” said Jude.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
“I’d as soon go about in them pajamas of yours.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe was silent for a moment. It amazed him the
familiarity that had suddenly sprung up between himself
and these two.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come aboard and have a look around?”
asked Tyler, as though suddenly stricken with the sense
of his own inhospitality.</p>

<p>“But the boat?”</p>

<p>“Stream her on a line—over with a line, Jude!”</p>

<p>A line came smack into the dinghy, and Ratcliffe tied
it to the painter ring. Next moment he was on board,
and the dinghy, taking the current, drifted astern.</p>

<p>No sooner had his feet touched the deck of the <i>Sarah
Tyler</i> than he felt himself encircled by a charm. It
seemed to him that he had never been on board a real
ship before this. The <i>Dryad</i> was a structure of steel
and iron, safe and sure as a railway train, a conveyance,
a mechanism made to pound along against wind
and sea; as different from this as an aëroplane from a
bird.</p>

<p>This little deck, these high bulwarks, spars, and
weather-worn canvas,—all them collectively were the real
thing. Daring and distance and freedom and the power
to wander at will, the inconsequence of the gulls,—all
these were hinted at here. Old man Tyler had built the
boat, but the sea had worked on her and made her what
she was, a thing part of the sea as a puffin.</p>

<p>Frowzy looking at a distance, on deck the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>
showed no sign of disorder. The old planking was
scrubbed clean and the brass of the little wheel shone.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
There was no raffle about, nothing to cumber the deck
but a boat,—the funniest-looking boat in the world.</p>

<p>“Canvas built,” said Tyler, laying his hand on her;
“Pap’s invention; no more weight than an umbrella.
No, she ain’t a collapsible: just canvas and hickory and
cane. That’s another of Pap’s dodges over there, that
sea anchor, and there’s ’nother, that jigger for raising the
mudhook. Takes a bit of time, but half a man could
work it, and I reckon it would raise a battleship. There’s
the spare, same as the one that’s in the mud—ever see
an anchor like that before? Pap’s. It’s a patent, but
he was done over the patentin’ of it by a shark in
Boston.”</p>

<p>“He must have been a clever man,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“He was,” said Tyler. “Come below.”</p>

<p>The cabin of the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> showed a table in the
middle, a hanging bunch of bananas, seats upholstered in
some sort of leather, a telltale compass fixed in the ceiling,
racks for guns and nautical instruments, and a bookcase
holding a couple of dozen books. A sleeping cabin
guarded by a curtain opened aft. Nailed to the bulkhead
by the bookcase was an old photograph in a frame,
the photograph of a man with a goatee beard, shaggy
eyebrows, and a face that seemed stamped out of determination—or
obstinacy.</p>

<p>“That’s him,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Your father?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“It was took after Mother bolted,” said Tyler.</p>

<p>“She took off with a long-shore Baptis’ minister,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Jude. “Said she couldn’t stand Pap’s unbelievin’ ways.”</p>

<p>“He made her work for him in a laundry,” said Tyler.</p>

<p>“It was at Pensacola, up the gulf, and a year after,
when we fetched up there again, she came aboard and
died. Pap went for the Baptis’ man.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t any more use for a Baptis’ minister when
Pap had done with him,” said Jude. “That’s his books—Pap’s.
There’s dead loads more in the spare bunk in
there.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe looked at the books. Old man Tyler’s mentality
interested him almost as much as the history of the
Tyler family,—“Ben Hur,” Paine’s “Age of Reason” and
“Rights of Man,” Browne’s “Popular Mechanics,” “The
Mechanism of the Watch,” “Martin Chuzzlewit,” and
some moderns, including an American edition of “Jude
the Obscure.”</p>

<p>“Some of those came off a wreck he had the pickin’s
of,” said Tyler, “a thousand-tonner that went ashore off
Cat Island.”</p>

<p>“That was before Jude was born,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Lord! how do you know that?” said Jude.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe laughed and pointed to the book. “It’s the
name on that book,” said he. “I didn’t know: I just
guessed.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right,” said Tyler, opening a locker
and fetching out cups and saucers and plates and dumping
them on the table. “Not that it matters much where
it come from, but you’ve got eyes in your head, that’s
sure. Say, you’ll stay to breakfast, now you’re
aboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“I’d like to,” said Ratcliffe, “but I ought to be getting
back: they won’t know what’s become of me. And besides
I’m in these.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy fixed,” said Tyler. “Jude, tumble up
and take the boat over to the hooker and say the gentleman
is stayin’ to breakfast an’ll be back directly after.
I’ll fix him for clothes.”</p>

<p>Jude vanished, and Tyler, going into the after-cabin,
rousted out an old white drill suit of “Pap’s” and a pair
of No. 9 canvas shoes.</p>

<p>“They’re new washed since he wore them,” said Tyler.
“Slip ’em on over your what’s his names and come along
and lend me a hand in the galley—can you cook?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Eased in his mind as to the <i>Dryad</i>, the boy in him rose
to this little adventure, delightful after weeks of routine
and twenty years of ordered life and high respectability.
He had caravaned, yachted in a small way, fancied that
he had at all events touched the fringe of the Free Life—he
had never been near it. These sea gipsies in their
grubby old boat were It! A grim suspicion that these
remains of the Tyler family sailed sometimes pretty close
to the law and that their sea pickings were, to put it
mildly, various did not detract in the least from their
charm. He guessed instinctively they were not rogues
of a bad sort. The lantern-jawed Satan had not the face
of a saint. There were indications in it indeed of the
possibility of a devilish temper no less than a desperate
daring, but not a trace of meanness. Jude was astonishingly
and patently honest, while old man Tyler, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
presence seemed still to linger on in this floating caravan,
had evident titles, of a sort, to respect.</p>

<p>He was helping to fry fish over the oil-stove in the
little galley when Jude returned with the information, delivered
through the shouting of the frying pan, that everything
was all right, and the message had been delivered
to a “guy” in a white coat who was hanging his fat head
over the starboard rail of the <i>Dryad</i>; that he had told her
to mind his paint; that she had told him not to drop his
teeth overboard, and he had “sassed” her back; that the
<i>Dryad</i> was a dandy ship, but would be a lot dandier if
she were hove up on some beach convenient for pickin’
her.</p>

<p>Then she started to make the coffee over an auxiliary
stove, mixing her industry with criticisms of the cookery
and instructions as to how fish should be fried.</p>

<p>“Jude does the cookin’ mostly,” said Tyler, “and we’d
have hot rolls only we were under sail last night and
she hadn’t time to set the dough. We’ll have to make
out with ship’s bread.”</p>

<p>Considering the condition of Jude’s grubby hands, Ratcliffe
wasn’t sorry.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">BREAKFAST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> amount of food those two put away was a revelation
to Ratcliffe, and from start to finish of the
meal they never stopped talking. One being silent, the
other took up the ball. They had cottoned to Ratcliffe,
evidently from the very first moment, for, at the very
first moment, Tyler had been communicative about himself
and his ship and his way of life. An ordinary ship’s
officer coming alongside would have got fish at a price
if he had been civil or a fish flung at his head if he had
given “sass”: Ratcliffe got friendship.</p>

<p>It was maybe his youth and the fact that all young
people are Freemasons that did the business; the humor
of the gorgeous pajamas may have helped. Anyhow, the
fact remained. He had secured something that knowledge
or position or fortune could not have bought,—the
good will and conversation of this pair, the history of
the Tylers, and more than a hint of their life on these
seas. They had four thousand dollars in the bank at
Havana left by Pap, not to be touched unless the <i>Sarah
Tyler</i> came to smash. They had no house rent or rates;
no expenses but harbor dues, food, oil, and tobacco, and
not much expense for food—at least just at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Tyler winked across the table at Jude and Jude grinned.</p>

<p>“Shut your head,” said Jude, “and don’t be givin’
shows away!” then suddenly to Ratcliffe, “We’ve got
a cache.”</p>

<p>“Who’s giving shows away now?” asked Tyler.</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t split,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“It’s on the island here,” said Tyler, “near a ton of
stuff, canned. A brig went ashore south of Mariguana.
We picked up the crew and heard their yarn and got the
location. Then a big freighter came along and took the
men off us. The wreck was only a hundred and fifty
miles from our position, and we reckoned the salvage
men wouldn’t be on the spot for a fortnight or more
and something was due to us for savin’ that crew; so
we lit out for the wreck. We had four days’ work on
her. She was straddled on a reef with twenty fathoms
under her counter and a flat calm, all but a breathin’ of
wind. We made fast to her, same as if she’d been a
wharf. We had the nigger then to help, and we took
enough grub to last us two years an’ fourteen boxes
of Havana cigars and a live cat that was most a
skeleton.”</p>

<p>“She croaked,” put in Jude. “Satan fed her half a
can of beef cut small, and then she scoffed half a
bucket of water—that bust her.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have been so free in taking the things
but for the lie of the hooker on the reef and the weather
that was sure coming,” said Tyler. “We knew all about
the weather and the chances. And we didn’t cast off
from that hooker an hour too soon! We were ridin’ out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that gale three days, and when we passed the reef again
making west the brig was gone.”</p>

<p>“And you cached the stuff here?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“But we hadn’t to make no cache hole,” put in Jude.
“Pap had one here. It’s among the bushes—and he didn’t
make it, neither.”</p>

<p>“It’s all coral rock a foot under the bushes,” said
Tyler, “and there’s a hole you drop down six foot, that
leads to a cave as cool as a refrigerator; so the goods
would keep to the last trumpet. The old Spaniards must
have cut it to hide their stuff in. Pap dropped on it by
chance. Said they’d used it for hidin’ gold and such.
Not that he believed in the buried treasure business—sunk
ships is different.”</p>

<p>Jude, who was hacking open a can of peaches, suddenly
made an awful face at Satan. It had the effect of
cutting him short. Ratcliffe refused the peaches. He
sat watching this pair of cormorants and thinking that
the cache must be pretty big if it held two years’ provisions
for them.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he said so, laughing and without giving
the least offense. Tyler explained that the cache was not
their only larder: there were fish and turtle and turtle
eggs, birds sometimes, fruit to be had for next to nothing,
often for nothing. The only expense was for tobacco,
and he had not paid ten cents for tobacco since last fall
and wouldn’t want to for a year to come; clothes, and
they didn’t want much clothes, Jude did the mending and
patching; paint, and the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> had ways and means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of getting paint and all such, spars and so on. He gave
a wonderful instance:</p>

<p>Before Christmas last they had chummed up with a
big yacht on the Florida coast near Cedar Cays. Thelusson
was the owner, a man from New York. He took a
fancy to the <i>Sarah</i> and her way of life, and he and his
crew helped to careen her in a lagoon back of the reefs,
cleaned her copper (she was dead foul with barnacles
and weeds), gave her a new main boom and foresail and
some spare canvas, and all for nix. He had no paint, or
he would have painted her. He drank champagne by the
bucket, and he wanted to quit the yacht and go for a
cruise with them, only his missus who was on board
wouldn’t let him.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe thought he could visualize Thelusson.</p>

<p>“She was a mutt,” put in Jude, “with a voice like a
muskeeter.”</p>

<p>“She wanted to ’dopt Jude and stick a skirt on her,”
said Tyler.</p>

<p>“Handed me out a lot of sick stuff about sayin’ prayers
and such,” hurriedly cut in Jude.</p>

<p>“And put the nightcap on it by kissin’ her,” finished
Tyler.</p>

<p>Jude’s face blazed red like a peony.</p>

<p>“If you chaps have had enough, I’m goin’ to clear,”
said Jude.</p>

<p>“Right!” said Satan, rising, and she cleared, vanishing
with the swiftness of a rabbit up the companionway.</p>

<p>Tyler fetched out a box of cigars. They were Ramon
Alones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
“She won’t speak to me now for half a day,” said
Tyler. “If you want to guy Jude, tell her she’s a girl.
I wouldn’t a told you, only you’re not in our way of life
and so can’t make trouble. No one knows. There’s not
a man in any of the ports knows: she goes as me brother.
But the Thelusson woman spotted her on sight—Come
on deck.”</p>

<p>Jude was emptying a bucket of refuse overboard, then
she vanished into the galley, and Ratcliffe, well fed, lazy,
and smoking his cigar, leaned for a moment over the
rail before taking his departure, talking to Tyler.</p>

<p>To starboard lay Palm Island, with the sea quietly
creaming on the coral beach and the palms stirring to the
morning wind, to port the white <i>Dryad</i> riding to her
anchor on the near-shore blue, and beyond the <i>Dryad</i> the
violet of the great depths spreading to the far horizon,
beyond which lay Andros, and the islands, reefs, and
banks from Great Abeco to Rum Cay. Not a sail on
all that sea, nor a stain on all that splendor: nothing but
the gulls wheeling and crying over the reefs to southward.</p>

<p>But Satan’s mind as he leaned beside Ratcliffe was
not engaged by the beauty of the morning or the charm
of the view. Satan was a dealer with the sea and the
things that came out of the sea or were even to be met
with floating on the waves. Ratcliffe was one of these
things.</p>

<p>“You’ve never had no call to work?” said Satan tentatively.
“You’ve lots of money, I s’pect, and can take
things easy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
“Like fishin’?”</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ever wants to see good fishin’ and more
than ordinary folk see of the islands here, drop me a
word to Havana. Kellerman, marine store dealer,
Havana, will get me. He’s a pal of mine. I fetch up
in Havana every six months or so—and there’s more
than fishin’—”</p>

<p>Tyler stopped short, then he spat overboard and began
to fill his pipe. He had no use for cigars—much.</p>

<p>“How do you mean more than fishing?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. We’re underhanded a bit for
any big job and I wouldn’t trust most men. They don’t
grow trustable parties in Havana, nor the coast towns—not
much. I’ve taken a likin’ to you somehow or ’nother,
and if ever we come together again I’ll tell you maybe
somethin’ that’s in my mind. You see, between Pap and
me and the old <i>Sarah</i>, we’ve seen close on thirty years of
these waters right from Caicos to N’y’Orleans and down
to Trinidad. Turtle egg huntin’ and fishin’ and tradin’,
there’s not a reef or cay we don’t know. The old <i>Sarah</i>
could find her way round blind. Put her before the wind
with the wheel half a spoke weather helm and leave her,
and she’d sniff the reefs on her own.”</p>

<p>“You were saying about something more than fishing,”
persisted Ratcliffe, whose curiosity had been, somehow,
aroused.</p>

<p>“I was,” said Tyler; “but I’m not free to speak about
private affairs without Jude, and there’s no use in
tacklin’ her when she’s snorty. Listen to that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Sounds were coming from the galley as of a person
banging pots and pans about.</p>

<p>Tyler chuckled.</p>

<p>“It’s always the same when her dander is up,—she
starts cleanin’ and dustin’ and makin’ hell of the place.
Mother was the same. I reckon a woman can’t help
bein’ a woman, not if she had a hundred pair of breeches
on.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ratcliffe, “I’d like to come for a cruise,
and I will some day, I hope. Maybe I’ll see you on the
island later. I was intending going ashore today to have
a look round: that’s why we anchored here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll see you ashore then,” said Tyler, “but if
I’m not there, mind and say nothin’ of the cache.”</p>

<p>“Right!”</p>

<span class="subhead">PAP’S SUIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Jude, having</span> been fetched out of the galley, the canvas
boat was got overboard.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe had offered to shed Pap’s suit and return in
his pajamas as he had come, but Tyler vetoed the idea.
The far-seeing Satan, who had snaffled a careen and clean
up, not to speak of a main boom and spare canvas, out
of Thelusson, had an object in view.</p>

<p>“It’s no trouble,” said he. “You take the dinghy, and
we’ll take the boat and fetch the duds back. It’s late in
the mornin’ for you to be boarding your ship in them
colored things.”</p>

<p>One of the big fish caught that morning was dropped
into the boat as a “present for the yacht,” and they
started.</p>

<p>The accommodation ladder was down and Simmons and
a quartermaster received Ratcliffe. As he went up the
side he heard Tyler shouting to Simmons something about
the fish. There was no sign of Skelton on deck, for
which he was thankful, then he dived below to change.</p>

<p>Now “Pap’s” suit had been constructed for a man of
over six feet and broad in proportion and a man, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
who liked his clothes loose and easy. On Ratcliffe
they recalled the vesture of Dr. Jekyll on Mr. Hyde.
The saloon door was closed. He opened it, and found
himself face to face with Skelton, who was sitting at
one end of the saloon table reading from a book, while
Strangways the captain, Norton the first officer, Prosser
the steward, and sundry others ranged according to their
degree sat at attention.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning. He had forgotten that fact,
and there was no drawing back. He reached his cabin,
mumbling apologies to the dead silence which seemed
crystallized round Skelton, closed the door, and stuffed
his head among the pillows of his bunk to stifle his
laughter, then he undressed and dressed.</p>

<p>As he dressed he could hear through the open port the
voice of Tyler from alongside. The voice was pitched in
a conversational key; it was saying something about a
lick of white paint. He was talking evidently to Simmons.</p>

<p>Then, fully dressed, with the bundle of clothes and the
canvas shoes under his arm, Ratcliffe peeped into the
saloon. The service was over and the saloon was empty.
He reached the deck. It was deserted save for a few
hands forward and Simmons.</p>

<p>Then he came down the accommodation ladder to the
stage, and handed the clothes over to Satan.</p>

<p>A drum of white paint and a coil of spare rope were
in the boat close to Jude, and Satan was saying to Simmons
something about a spare ax.</p>

<p>“Well, if you haven’t got one, there’s no more to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
said,” finished Satan; then to Ratcliffe, “See you ashore,
maybe.”</p>

<p>Jude grinned kindly, and they pushed off, the boat a
strake lower in the water with their loot.</p>

<p>The fat-faced Simmons watched them with the appearance
of a man just released from mesmerism.</p>

<p>“That chap would talk the hat off one’s head,” said
he. “I’ll have h—l to pay with Norton over that paint;
most likely I’ll have to put my hand in my own pocket
for it. But he’s a decent chap, that fellow, but sharp—the
way he landed me with that fish for a bait!”</p>

<p>“He’s all there,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“So’s the boy,” said Simmons. “Come alongside after
you’d gone, to say you were staying to breakfast with
them. Told him to mind and not damage the paint.
Let out like a bargee at me—and Sir William Skelton
listening!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Sir William now, Simmons? He wasn’t in
the saloon when I’d finished dressing.”</p>

<p>“I expect he’s in his cabin,” said Simmons.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe got a book and, taking his seat under the
double awning sheltering the quarterdeck, tried to read.
He had chosen a History of the West Indies, the same
book most likely from which Skelton had “cadged” his
information of the night before. The printed page was
dull, however, compared to the spoken word, and he
found himself wondering how it was that Skelly could
have warmed him up so to all this stuff and yet be such
an angular stick-in-the-mud in ordinary life. What made
him such a superior person? What made him at thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
look forty, sometimes fifty, and what made him, Ratcliffe,
fear Skelly sometimes, just as a schoolboy fears
a master?</p>

<p>He guessed he was in for a wigging now for cutting
breakfast and appearing like a guy before the officers,
and he knew instinctively the form the wigging would
take,—a chilly manner and studious avoidance of the
subject, that would be all,—Christchurch on a wet Sunday
for forty-eight hours, with the Oxford voice and
the Oxford manner accentuated and thrown in.</p>

<p>At this moment Sir William Skelton, Bart., came on
deck,—a tall, thin man, clean shaved, like a serious-minded
butler in a yachting suit of immaculate white
drill. His breeding lay chiefly in his eyes: they were
half-veiled by heavy lids. He had an open mother-of-pearl-handled
penknife in his hand.</p>

<p>Free of the saloon hatch and not seeing Ratcliffe, he
stopped dead like a pointer before game and called out
“Quartermaster!”</p>

<p>A quartermaster came running aft.</p>

<p>Some raffle had been left on the scupper by the companionway,
a fathom or so of old rope rejected by Tyler
as not being the quality he was “wantin’.”</p>

<p>He ordered it to be taken forrard, then he saw Ratcliffe
and nodded.</p>

<p>“’Morning,” said Skelton.</p>

<p>He walked to the rail and stood with his hand on it
for a moment, looking at the island and the <i>Sarah
Tyler</i>.</p>

<p>Jude and Satan were at work on something aft. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
a minute it became apparent what they were doing. They
were rigging an awning in imitation of the <i>Dryad’s</i>, an
impudent affair made out of old canvas brown with
weather and patched from wear.</p>

<p>It was like seeing a beggar woman raising a parasol.</p>

<p>Skelton sniffed; then he turned and, leaning with his
back against the bulwarks, began attending to his left
little fingernail with the penknife.</p>

<p>“Ratcliffe,” said Skelton suddenly and apparently addressing
his little finger, “I <em>wish</em> you wouldn’t!” He
spoke mildly, in a vaguely pained voice. It was as
though Ratcliffe had acted in some way like a bounder;
more, and, wonderfully, he actually made Ratcliffe feel
as though he had acted in some way like a bounder. He
was Ratcliffe’s host; that gave an extra weight to the
words. The whole thing was horrible.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t what?” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Skelton had been rather hit in his proprieties by a man
going off his boat in pajamas and remaining away to
breakfast on board a thing like the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> in his
pajamas; but the real cause of offense was “Pap’s” suit
suddenly appearing at Sunday morning prayers. The
chief steward had grinned.</p>

<p>Skelton, though a good sailor, an excellent shipmaster,
and as brave as a man need be, was a highly nervous
individual. A general service on deck for the whole crew
was beyond him: he compromised by conducting a short
service in the saloon. Even that was a tax on him. The
entrance of Ratcliffe in that extraordinary get-up had
joggled his nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“If you can’t understand, I can’t explain,” said Skelton.
“If our cases had been reversed, I should have
apologized. However, it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Skelly!” said Ratcliffe. “I’m most awfully
sorry if I have jumped on your corns, and I’ll
apologize as much as you want, but the fact of the matter
is we don’t seem to hit it off exactly, do we? You are
the best of good people, but we have different temperaments.
If those other fellows had come along on the
cruise, it would have mixed matters more. We want to
be mixed up in a big party more, you and I, if we want
to get on together.”</p>

<p>“I told you before we started I disliked crowds,” said
Skelton, “and that only Satherthwaite and Magnus were
coming. Then, when they failed, you said it didn’t
matter, that we should be freer and more comfortable
alone.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Ratcliffe. “It was my mistake, and
besides I didn’t want to put you off the cruise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you would not have put me off. I should have
started alone. I am dependent on no one for society.”</p>

<p>“I believe you would have been happier alone.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Skelton with tight lips.</p>

<p>“Well then, shove me ashore, somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That is talking nonsense!” said Skelton.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe had risen and was leaning over the rail beside
the other. His eyes were fixed on the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>, the
disreputable <i>Sarah</i>, and as he looked at her Jude and
Satan suddenly seemed to him real live free human beings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
and Skelton as being not entirely alive nor, for all
his wealth, free.</p>

<p>It was Skelton who gave the Tylers a nimbus, extra
color, fascination, especially Jude. There was a lot of
fascination about Jude, even without the background of
Skelton.</p>

<p>“It’s not talking nonsense a bit,” said he, “and, if you
can trundle along the rest of the cruise alone, I’ll drop
you here.”</p>

<p>“Drop you on this island?”</p>

<p>“No—I’d like to go for a cruise with those chaps—I
mean that chap in the mud barge over there. He asked
me, any time I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Are you in earnest?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. It would be no end of a picnic,
and I want to shove round these seas. I can get a boat
back from Havana.”</p>

<p>Skelton felt that this was the washerwoman of Barbados
over again,—irresponsibility—bad form. He was,
under his courteousness as a host, heartily sick of Ratcliffe
and his ways and outlook. A solitary by inclination,
he would not at all have objected to finishing this
cruise by himself. All the same, he strongly objected
to the idea just put before him.</p>

<p>What made him object? Was he insulted that the
<i>Dryad</i> should be turned down in favor of the frowzy, disreputable-looking
<i>Sarah Tyler</i>, that the companionship
of the Tylerites should be preferred to his? Did some
vague instinct tell him they were the better people to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
with if one wanted to have a good time? Was high
conventionality outraged as though, walking down Piccadilly
with Ratcliffe, the latter were to seize the arm
of a dustman?</p>

<p>Who knows? But he bitterly and strongly objected.
And how and in what words did he show his objection
and anger?</p>

<p>“Then go, my dear fellow, go!” said he as though with
all the good will in the world.</p>

<p>“Right!” said Ratcliffe. “But are you sure you don’t
mind?”</p>

<p>“Mind! Why should I mind?”</p>

<p>“One portmanteau full of stuff will do me,” said Ratcliffe,
“and I have nearly a hundred and fifty in ready
money and a letter of credit on the Lyonnaise at Havana
for five hundred. I’ll trundle my stuff over if you’ll
lend me a boat, and be back for luncheon. You’ll be
off this evening, I suppose, and I can stay aboard here
till you get the anchor up. It’s possible I might pick you
up at Havana on the way back; but don’t worry about
that. Of course all this depends on whether that fellow
will take me. I’ll take the portmanteau with me and
ask.”</p>

<p>He did not in the least see what was going on in Skelton’s
mind.</p>

<p>“You will take your things with you in a boat, and
if this—gentleman refuses to take you, what then?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back.”</p>

<p>“Now I want to be quite clear with you, Ratcliffe,”
said Skelton. “If you leave my ship like that—for nothing—at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
a whim and for disreputable chance acquaintances—absolute
scowbankers—the worst sort—I want to be
clear with you—quite, absolutely definite—I must ask you
not to come back!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m hanged!” said Ratcliffe, suddenly blazing
out. “First you say go and then you say don’t! Of
course that’s enough: you’ve practically fired me off your
boat.”</p>

<p>“Do not twist my words,” said the other. “That is
a subtle form of prevarication I can’t stand.”</p>

<p>“I think we had better stop this,” said Ratcliffe. “I’m
going! If I don’t see you again. I’ll say goodby.”</p>

<p>“And please understand,” said the other, who was
rather white about the mouth, “please understand—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” said Ratcliffe. “Goodby!”</p>

<p>He dived below to the saloon and rang for his bedroom
steward.</p>

<p>Burning with anger and irritation and a feeling that
he had been sat upon by Skelton, snubbed, sneered at,
and altogether outrageously used, he could not trust
himself to do his own packing. He sat on his bunkside
while the steward stuffed a portmanteau with necessaries,
and as he sat the thought came to him of what would
happen were Tyler to refuse to take him. He would
have to take refuge on Palm Island. It was a comic
opera sort of idea; yet, such was the state of his mind,
he actually entertained it.</p>

<p>Skelton was no longer “Skelly,” but “that beast Skelton.”
Then he tipped the steward and the chief steward,
telling them that he was going for a cruise in that “yawl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
over there.” On deck he met Norton and Simmons
and told them the same tale. Skelton had vanished to
his cabin. He told the first and second officers that he
had said goodby to his host and asked for a boat to be
lowered.</p>

<p>“I’ll pick you up most likely at Havana,” said he to
gloze the matter over. “I expect I’ll have a good time,
but rather rough. I want to do some fishing.”</p>

<p>The whole thing seemed like a dream and not a particularly
pleasant one. Embarked on this business now,
he almost wished himself done with it. The yacht was
comfortable, the cooking splendid; to satisfy any want,
one had only to touch a bell. There were no bells on
board the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>. A lavatory and a sort of bathroom
invented by “Pap” were the only conveniences, and
the bath was impracticable. It was “Pap’s” only failure,
for the sea-cock connecting it with the outer ocean was
so arranged or constituted that as likely as not it would
let in the Caribbean before you could “stop it off.”</p>

<p>If Skelton now, at the last moment, had asked Ratcliffe
to come down and have an interview, things might
have been smoothed over, but Skelton was not the sort
of man to make advances; neither, in his way, was Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Simmons was directing the lowering of a
boat. The companionway was still down. The luggage
was put in, and Simmons, seated by Ratcliffe in the stern
seats, took the yoke lines. Not a sign of Skelton, not
even a face at a porthole!</p>

<p>“Give way!” shouted Simmons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
As they drew up to the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>, Ratcliffe saw
Satan leaning over the rail and watching them. Jude
was nowhere visible.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Ratcliffe as they came alongside. “I’ve
come back.”</p>

<p>“I was half-expectin’ you,” said Satan with a grin.</p>

<p>“Will you take me for that cruise right off?”</p>

<p>“Sure! That your dunnage?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Satan stepped to the cabin companionway and shouted
down it.</p>

<p>“Jude!”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” came Jude’s voice.</p>

<p>“He’s come back!”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE PORTMANTEAU</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> Jude came on deck the portmanteau was being
hoisted on board. Ratcliffe passed down a five-pound
note to the boat’s crew, and then stood, waving
to Simmons as the boat put away. Then, turning to
Satan, he tried to discuss terms, but was instantly silenced
by Jude and Satan. They would hear nothing of money.
Used to sea changes and strange happenings, they seemed
to think nothing of the business, and after the first words
fell to talking together.</p>

<p>The trend of their talk induced in Ratcliffe a vaguely
uncanny feeling. It was as though they had already discussed
his coming on board and the storage of himself
and his baggage, as though they had known by instinct
that he would return. The size of the portmanteau
affected Jude.</p>

<p>“You can’t keep that,” said Jude, giving the portmanteau
a slight kick. “It’s a long sight too big. Say, what
have you got in it?”</p>

<p>“Clothes.”</p>

<p>“Pajamas?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and lots of other things.”</p>

<p>Jude tilted back the old panama she was wearing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
took her seat on the portmanteau. Her feet were bare,
and she twisted her toes in thought as she sat for a
moment turning matters over in her mind.</p>

<p>“You can stick the things in the spare locker,” said
she at last. “You gonna have a gay old time if you
keep this in the cabin, tumblin’ over it. Better empty
her here an’ cart the stuff below.”</p>

<p>“Right!” said Ratcliffe. “But what shall I do with the
portmanteau when it’s empty?”</p>

<p>“Heave her overboard,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Shut your head!” said Tyler, suddenly cutting in.
“What you talkin’ about? Heave yourself overboard!”
Then to Ratcliffe, “She’s right, all the same; there’s no
room for luggage. If you’ll help Jude to get the things
below, I’ll look after the trunk. When you’ve done with
the cruise you can get a bag to hold your things.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe opened the portmanteau. The steward of the
<i>Dryad</i> was an expert: in a past existence he had probably
been a pack rat. In any given space he could have
tucked away half as much again as any other ordinary
mortal. But he certainly had no imagination, or perhaps
he had been too busy to cast his eye overboard and
see the manner of craft Ratcliffe was joining, and Ratcliffe
had been far too much exercised in his mind about
Skelton to notice what was being packed.</p>

<p>Jude on her knees helped.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked Jude, coming on a black satin
lining.</p>

<p>“Confound the fool!” said Ratcliffe. “He needn’t have
packed that: it’s a dinner jacket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“Mean to say you sit down to your dinner in a jacket?”
Jade choked and snorted while Ratcliffe hurriedly, on his
knees, hauled out the trousers and waistcoats that went
with the garments.</p>

<p>“That’s the lining—it’s worn the other way about—I
know it’s tomfoolery. Stick ’em all in one bundle—Lord!
look at the shirts he’s packed!”</p>

<p>“They’ve got tucks in them,” said Jude, looking at the
pleated fronts.</p>

<p>“I know. They go with that tomfool dinner suit.
You can’t knock sense into the head of a bedroom
steward. Come along and let’s get them down below.”</p>

<p>While they were carting the stuff down, Satan on the
hatch cover cut himself a chew of tobacco (he sometimes
chewed) and, with his lantern jaws working regularly
like the jaws of a cow chewing the cud, contemplated
the steadily emptying portmanteau.</p>

<p>He had a plan about that portmanteau, a plan to turn
it to profit. Satan’s plans generally had profit for their
object. He had taken a genuine liking for Ratcliffe; but
it was a curious thing with Satan that even his likings
generally helped him along toward profit,—perhaps because
they were the outcome of a keen intelligence that
had been sharpened by knocking about among rascals,
beachcombers, wharf rats, as well as honest folk.</p>

<p>When Ratcliffe had fetched down the last load and
come up again, he found Satan and the portmanteau
gone.</p>

<p>The canvas boat had not been brought on board, but
streamed astern on a line. He looked over the side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Satan was in the boat with the portmanteau and in the
act of pushing off.</p>

<p>“I’m takin’ her back to the yacht,” said Satan.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe nodded.</p>

<p>At that moment Jude came on deck blinking and hitching
up her trousers. She had washed her face and made
herself a bit more tidy,—perhaps because she had remembered
it was Sunday or perhaps because company
had come on board. She had evidently put her whole
head into the water. It was dripping, and as she stood
with the old panama in her hand and her cropped hair
drying in the sun Ratcliffe observed her anew and
thought that he had never seen a more likable figure.
Jude would never be pretty, but she was better than
pretty,—healthy, honest and capable, trusting and fearless,
easily reflecting laughter, and with a trace of the irresponsibility
of youth. It was a face entirely original
and distinctive. Dirty, it was the face of a larrikin;
washed, a face such as I have attempted to describe; and
the eyes were extraordinary,—liquid-gray, with a look of
distance, when she was serious, a look acquired perhaps
from life among vast sea spaces.</p>

<p>“Where’s Satan?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe pointed.</p>

<p>Jude, shading her eyes, looked. Then she laughed.</p>

<p>“Thought he was up to somethin’,” said she. “He’s
gone to kid that officer man out of some more truck.”</p>

<p>In a flash Ratcliffe saw the reason of Satan’s activities,
and in another flash he saw again, or seemed to see, in
Satan and Jude a pair of gipsies of the sea. A gipsies’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
caravan camped close to a neat villa,—that was the relationship
between the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> and the <i>Dryad</i>,—and
Satan was the caravan man gone round to the villa’s
back door to return an empty portmanteau and blarney
the servants out of scraps and old odds and ends not
wanted, maybe to commandeer a chicken or nick a doormat—heaven
only knew! He remembered the fancy
Satan had taken to the dinghy. And he, Ratcliffe, had
thrown in his lot with these people! Fishing cruise!
Rubbish! Gipsy patter, sea thimblerigging, wreck-picking,
and maybe petty larceny from Guadaloupe to dry
Tortugas,—that was what he had signed on for. Why,
the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>, could she have been hauled into any
law court, would have stood convicted on her very appearance!
Jude was honest enough in her way; but her
way was Satan’s way, and she had owned up with steadfast,
honest eyes to the plundering of a brig and the
caching of the plunder. They were “passons to what
Pap had been,” but they were his offspring, and the law
to them was no doubt what it had been to him,—a something
to be avoided or outwitted, like a dangerous animal.</p>

<p>All these thoughts running through his head did not
disturb him in the least. Far from that! The reckless
in him had expanded since he had cut the cable connecting
him with the <i>Dryad</i>, and not for worlds would he
have changed the <i>Sarah</i> into a vessel of more conventional
form, or altered Satan from whatever he might be
into a figure of definite respectability.</p>

<p>He reckoned that if Satan broke the law he would be
clever enough to avoid the consequences. His tongue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
alone would get him out of most fixes, and just this touch
of gipsiness in the business gave a new flavor to life,—the
flavor boys seek when they raid orchards and hen-roosts
and go pirating with corked faces and lath swords.</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ aboard her,” said Jude.</p>

<p>The portmanteau had been taken up by one of the
crew, and now Satan, evidently at the invitation of one
of the white-clad figures leaning over the rail of the
<i>Dryad</i>, was going up the accommodation ladder, leaving
the boat to wash about in the blue water by the stage.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe guessed that one of the white-clad figures was
Skelton and that it was on Skelton’s invitation he had
gone on board. He felt vaguely uneasy. What did
Skelton mean by that? Was he up to any dodge to
“crab” the cruise?</p>

<p>However, he had no time to bother over this, for Jude,
who had him now to herself without fear of interruption,
had opened her batteries.</p>

<p>“Say,” said Jude, hanging over the rail where the
awning cast its shadow, speaking without looking at him
and spitting into the water, “what are you when you’re
ashore, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I’m one of the idle rich,” said Ratcliffe, lighting his
pipe.</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t be idle aboard here,” said Jude definitely.
“What was your dad? Was your dad an idle-rich?”</p>

<p>“No, he was a ship owner.”</p>

<p>“How many ships did he own?”</p>

<p>“About forty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
“What sort?”</p>

<p>“Steamers.”</p>

<p>“What sizes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything from two to five thousand tons.”</p>

<p>She turned to see if he were guying her.</p>

<p>“There was another man in the business,” said Ratcliffe,
“a partner; Ratcliffe &amp; Holt was the same of the
firm. The governor died intestate.”</p>

<p>“Somethin’ wrong with his inside?”</p>

<p>“No, he died of a stroke; he was found in his office
chair dead; he died at his work.”</p>

<p>“Did they get the chap that did him in?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t a man that struck him; it was apoplexy,
a disease, and dying without a will, all his money was
divided up between my two brothers and me.”</p>

<p>“How much did you get?”</p>

<p>“Over a hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“Dollars?”</p>

<p>“No, pounds—four hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Got ’em still?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“In the bank?”</p>

<p>“Some; the rest is invested.”</p>

<p>She seemed to lose interest in the money business and
hung for a moment over the rail, whistling almost noiselessly
between her teeth and kicking up a bare heel.
Then she said:</p>

<p>“Who’s the chap you were sailin’ with?”</p>

<p>“Skelton is his name.”</p>

<p>“He owns that hooker?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jude suddenly, as if waking from a
reverie, “this won’t boil potatoes—I’ve got to get dinner
ready. Come ’long and help if you’re willin’.”</p>

<p>There was half a sack of potatoes in the galley. She
set the stove going, and then, on her knees before the
open sack, she sent him to fetch half a bucket of water
from overboard. He found the bucket with a rope attached,
brought the water, and filled the potato kettle,
then he brought more water for the washing of the
potatoes.</p>

<p>She did the washing squatting on her heels before the
bucket.</p>

<p>“Where did you get them from?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Get which?”</p>

<p>“The potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Bought them,” said Jude; then, as though suddenly
smitten by rectitude, “No, we didn’t, nuther: we kidooled
them out of a fruiter.”</p>

<p>“What’s a fruiter?”</p>

<p>“Fruit steamer. Satan fixed her.”</p>

<p>“How did he fix her?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jude, “it’s no harm to hold up a packet
if you don’t throw her off her course—much. It’s the
owners pays, and they can stand the racket. The crew
likes it, and if there’s passengers aboard they just love
it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you hold up steamers?” asked
Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
“But how do you do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only now and then. What’s easier than to
lay in her course with the flag half-mast? Then she
heaves to.”</p>

<p>“And you board her and ask for potatoes, or whatever
you want?”</p>

<p>“Not much!” said Jude. “They’d boot you off the
ship. Water’s what you ask for, pretendin’ you’re dying
of thirst; then you drink till you’re near bustin’ and
fill the breaker you’ve brought with you. It’s all on the
square. Satan would never hold a ship unless he had
some fish to offer them for whatever he wants,—potatoes
or fruit or tobacco. He’s got the fish in the boat and
hands it up. They’re always glad of fresh fish and they
offer to buy it; but he won’t take money, but says, ‘If
you’ve got a few potatoes handy, I don’t mind takin’ them
for the fish.’ Sometimes it’s fruit he wants, or other
things. Then you push off—and if it’s a passenger
packet the passengers, thinkin’ they’ve saved you from
dyin’ of thirst, line up and cheer. It’s no end of fun.”</p>

<p>“What flag do you sail under?”</p>

<p>“’Murrican, what else? You see,” went on Jude as
she put the potatoes into the kettle, “fish costs nothing
to us and they’re mighty glad of it, but I reckon they’d
bat our heads off if they knew about the dyin’ of thirst
business.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you struck the same ship twice?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a job one does every day,” said Jude, with
a trace of contempt in her tone, “and Satan don’t wear
blinkers, and it’s not a job you could do at all if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
didn’t know the lie of the fishin’ banks by where the
ship tracks run. I reckon you’ve got to learn something
about things.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I have,” said Ratcliffe, laughing, “and I
bet you’ll teach me!”</p>

<p>“Well, shy that over to begin with,” said Jude, giving
him the pail of dirty water.</p>

<p>He flung the water over the side, and as he did so
he took a glance at the <i>Dryad</i>. Satan was in the boat
just pushing off. When he returned to the galley with
the news, Jude was preparing to fry fish: not the early
morning fish, but some caught just before Ratcliffe had
come on board.</p>

<p>Then he went to the rail again just as Satan was
coming alongside.</p>

<p>Satan had a cargo of sorts. His insatiable appetite
for canvas and rope was evidenced by the bundle in the
stern, and there were parcels. The return of the empty
portmanteau had not been waste labor.</p>

<p>“That’s coffee,” said he to Ratcliffe, handing up the
goods. “We were runnin’ short. And here’s biscuits—catch
a holt—and here’s some fancy muck in cans and
c’ndensed milk—I told the chap our cow died yesterday.
‘Take everything you want,’ says he. ‘Don’t mind me—I’m
only the owner.’ Offered me the mainsail as I
was putting off an’ told me to come back for the dinghy.
I’d told him I was sweet on her—full of fun he was—and
maybe I will. Claw hold of this bundle of matches—they’re
a livin’ Godsend—and here’s a case of canned
t’marters—and that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Skelton’s irony was evidently quite lost on Satan, or
put down to his “fun,” but Ratcliffe could appreciate
it, and the fact that its real target was himself.</p>

<p>The canned t’marters appeared with the food at dinner,
and during the meal more of Skelton came out.
He had offered Satan vinous liquors, hoping, so Ratcliffe
dimly suspected, to send him back a trouble to the
<i>Sarah Tyler</i> and an object lesson on the keeping of disreputable
company; but the wily Satan had no use for
liquor. He was on the water wagon.</p>

<p>“I leave all them sorts of things to Jude,” said he, with
a grin. He was referring to Jude’s boasted drunk at
Havana, and Ratcliffe, who was placed opposite to the
pair of them, across the table, saw Jude’s chin project.
Why she should boast of a thing one moment and fire
up at the mention of it at another was beyond him.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if she were going to
empty the dish of tomatoes over Satan, but she held
herself in, all but her tongue.</p>

<p>“You’d have been doin’ better work on board here,
mendin’ the gooseneck of that spare gaff, than wangling
old canvas an’ rope out of that man,” said she.
“We’re full up of old truck that’s no more use to us
than Solomon’s aunt. It’s in the family, I suppose,
seein’ what Granf’er was—”</p>

<p>“Oh, put a potato in your mouth!” said Satan.</p>

<p>“He used to peddle truck on the Canada border,” said
she to Ratcliffe,—“hams—”</p>

<p>“Close up!” said Satan.</p>

<p>“—made out o’ birchwood, and wooden nutmegs—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“That was Pap’s joke,” said Satan. “And another
word out of you and I’ll turn you over me knee and
take down your—”</p>

<p>“Then what do you want flingin’ old things in my
face?” cried Jude, wabbling between anger and tears.
“Some day I’ll take me hook, same as mother did.”</p>

<p>“There’s not a Baptis’ minister would look at you,”
said Satan, winking at Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Damn Baptis’ ministers! You may work your old
hooker yourself. I’ll skip! Two thousand of them dollars
is mine, and next time we touch Havana I’ll skip!”</p>

<p>“And where’ll you skip to?”</p>

<p>“I’ll start a la’ndry.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to black your face and wear a turban,
same as the others—and marry a nigger. I can
see you comin’ off for the ship’s washin’.”</p>

<p>Jude began to laugh in a crazy sort of way, then all
at once she sobered down and went on with her dinner.
One could never tell how her anger would end,—in tears,
laughter of a wild sort, or just nothing.</p>

<p>Not another word was said about the family history
of the Tylers, at least at that meal, and after it was
over Jude made Ratcliffe help to wash up the plates and
things in the galley.</p>

<p>“Satan’s Cap,” said Jude. “He never helps in the
washin’ or swillin’. Not cold water!—land’s sake! where
did you learn washin’ up?—hot! I’ve left some in that
billy on the stove.”</p>

<p>She had taken off her old coat and rolled her guernsey
sleeves up to the shoulders nearly, and it came to Ratcliffe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
as he helped that, without a word of remonstrance,
naturally, and as a part adapts itself to the economy of
a whole, he had sunk into the position of kitchen maid
and general help to the Tyler family, taken the place
of the nigger that had skipped; furthermore that Satan
was less a person than a subtle influence. Satan seemed
to obtain his ends more by wishing than by willing. He
wanted an extra hand, and he had somehow put the spell
of his wish on him, Ratcliffe. He had wished a drum
of paint out of Simmons—and look at Skelton, the cynical
and superior Skelton, sending off doles of coffee
and “t’marters” to the dingy and disreputable <i>Sarah
Tyler</i>, offering his mainsail to the rapacious Satan as
a gibe! What had he been but a marionette dancing on
the string of Satan’s wish?</p>

<p>Only for Jude and the <i>Sarah</i> and the queer new sense
of freedom from all the associations he had ever known,
only for something likable about Satan, the something
that gave him power to wheedle things out of people and
bend them to his wishes, Ratcliffe might have reacted
against the Tyler hypnotism. As it was, the whole business
seemed as jolly as a pantomime, as exciting as a
new form of novel in which the folk were real and himself
a character.</p>

<p>Leaving Satan and the old <i>Sarah</i> aside, and the extraordinary
fascination of spars, sails, narrow deck, and
close sea, catching one’s own fish, cooking one’s own
food, and dickering with winds, waves, reefs, and lee
shores for a living,—leaving all these aside, Jude alone
would have held him; for Jude gave him what he possessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
when he was nine,—the power of playing again,
of seeing everything new and fresh. Washing up dishes
with Jude was a game. To the whole-souled Jude all this
business was a game,—hauling on the halyards, fishing,
cooking, hanging on to the beard of a storm by the sea
anchor, wreck picking and so on,—and she had infected
him. Already they were good companions and, when
together, of the same age, about nine—though she was
fifteen and he over twenty.</p>

<p>“Stick them on that shelf,” said Jude. “Oh, Lord!—butter-fingers!—lemme!
That’s the gadget to keep them
from shiftin’ if the ship rolls. Now stick the knives in
that locker. You don’t mind my tellin’ you, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all.”</p>

<p>They found Satan under the awning, attending to the
gooseneck of the spare gaff.</p>

<p>Jude sat down on the deck clasping her knees, criticized
Satan’s handiwork, received instructions to hold
her tongue, and then collapsed, lying on her back with
knees up and the back of her hand across her eyes.
She could sleep at any odd moment.</p>

<p>The horizon had vanished in haze, the crying of the
gulls had died down, and the washing of the lazy swell
on the island beach sounded like a lullaby.</p>

<p>A trace of smoke was rising from the yellow funnel
of the <i>Dryad</i> as she lay like a white painted ship on a
blue painted ocean. They were firing up.</p>

<p>“How about getting ashore?” asked Ratcliffe. “I want
to see that cache of yours. Care to come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
“I’d just as soon leave it till they’re away,” said
Satan, jerking his hand toward the <i>Dryad</i>. “There’s
no tellin’, they might be spottin’ us on the location with
a glass, and they’ll be off tonight—so the chap told me.
You leave it to me and I’ll show you a cache better nor
that in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Satan!” came a drowsy voice from the
deck.</p>

<p>“Shut up yourself!” said Satan. “I’m not talkin’ of
what you mean: I’m talkin’ of the abalone reef—lyin’
there like a lazy dog and lippin’ your betters!”</p>

<p>“Where’s me betters?” cried Jude, sitting bang-up
suddenly, like the corpse in “Thou art the man.”</p>

<p>“I’m your betters.”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>“Me!”</p>

<p>Jude broke into a cracked laugh.</p>

<p>“Listen to him talkin’!” cried she to the universe in
general. “Ain’t fit to bile potatoes!” She was on her
feet, and he was after her with a rope’s end, dodging
her round the mast. “Touch me and I’ll tell him!” A
flick of the rope’s end caught her, and next moment she
was clinging to Ratcliffe and using him as her shield.
“It’s an old ship sunk south o’ Rum Key!” cried Jude.
“South o’ Rum Key! I told you I’d tell him if you
touched me.”</p>

<p>Satan dropped the rope and resumed the gooseneck
business.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it!” said he.</p>

<p>“Told you I would,” said Jude. She sat down on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
deck again as though nothing had happened and nursed
her knees.</p>

<p>“You needn’t mind me,” said Ratcliffe. “I won’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not that,” said Satan, “but Pap was mighty
particular about keepin’ close. He located that hooker
only three months before the fever took him—and he
didn’t come on it by chance nuther. And now Jude’s
given the show away!”</p>

<p>“I told you I’d tell him,” said Jude broodily.</p>

<p>“Told me you’d tell him! Why, ever since last fall
you’ve been at me to keep my tongue in my head about
it, and then you bring it out bing, first thing, yourself!
That’s a woman all over.”</p>

<p>“Who are you callin’ a woman?”</p>

<p>“Me aunt. Shut your head and give over handlin’
that ball of yarn, clutch hold of the gaff and keep it
steady while I fix this ring on her!”</p>

<p>He worked away in silence while Ratcliffe sat watching,
vaguely intrigued by what had just passed. It was
less the words than the place and circumstance,—the little
deck of the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>, the blue lazy sea, the voice of
the surf on Palm Island, the figure of Jude and Satan.
He had seen Rum Cay: They had passed it in a pink
and pearly dawn. The steward had called him up to
look at it. South of that lonely and fascinating place
old man Tyler had located a sunk ship. What sort of
ship he knew instinctively and that the Tylers were not
the people to halloo over nothing. The gulls did not
know these seas better than they. He said nothing, however.
It was Satan who spoke next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
“Pap had reckoned to lay for it this spring,” said
Satan, “but the fever took him. Then we were underhanded.
Jude and me can make out to work the boat
and get a livin’, but we’re too underhanded for a big
job. Why, takin’ that truck off the brig I told you about
near laid us out, and we had the nigger to help and she
was hove up so that it was like takin’ cargo off a wharfside.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Ratcliffe, “I’ll help if you care to
go for it. I don’t want any share: just the fun. What’s
in her?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan in a half-hearted way, “maybe we’ll
have a look at her; but it’s a job that wants more than
three by rights. Pap was three men in himself; he’d a
done it. It’s a dynamite job. She’s got to be blasted
open.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard stories about buried treasure in these
seas—” began Ratcliffe. Jude turned her head.</p>

<p>“That’s bilge,” said she.</p>

<p>“Yarns,” said Satan. “Pap used to turn any man
down that talked of stuff bein’ buried. First he said
that chaps didn’t bury stuff, second if they did you
couldn’t find it, what with earthquakes and sand siftin’
and such, and third that never an ounce of silver, or
gold for the matter of that, has ever been dug up by the
tomfools huntin’ for it. Havana is full of tall stories of
buried treasure—chaps make a livin’ sellin’ locations and
faked charts and the like of that. It’s a Spanish game,
and it takes good American money every year. You see,
Pap was a book-readin’ man,—taught himself to read,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
too, and didn’t start the job till he was near forty,—so
he had a head on him, but somehow or ’nother he never
made the money he ought. If he’d stuck in towns and
places, he’d have been a Rock’feller; but he liked beatin’
about free, said God’s good air was better than dollars.
But it stuck in him that he hadn’t made out, somehow.
Then he turned into unbelievin’ ways, Said he was a soci—what
was it, Jude?”</p>

<p>“Somethin’ or ’nother,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Socialist?” suggested Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“That’s it! Said the time was coming when all the
guys that were down under would be on top of the chaps
that were on top, and that there’d be such a hell of a
rough house money’d be no use anyway; said the time
was comin’ when eggs would be a dollar apiece and no
dollars to buy them with, and me and Jude would be
safest without money gettin’ our livin’ out of the sea.
He was a proper dirge when he got on that tack. But
all the same it stuck in him that he wasn’t on top, and
one night when he was in Diegos’ saloon he heard three
Spanish chaps layin’ their heads together. He knew the
lingo well enough to make out their meanin’. They
were in the bar. Pap wasn’t on the water wagon, but
he was no boozer. He was sittin’ there that night just
dead beat, as any man might be after the day’s work
he’d done, runnin’ the customs—”</p>

<p>“Luff!” said Jude in a warning voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, close your head! Think I am talkin’ to a customs
officer? He don’t care.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Ratcliffe. “Heave ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
“Well, he was sittin’ with his eyes shut, and he heard
these guys colludin’ together. He didn’t get more than
half they said, but he got enough to make him want to
hear more. Then they quit the bar and went into a back
room with their lemon juice and cigarettes. Ten minutes
after hell broke loose in that back room, and when
Pap and the bartender got the door open there was the
chaps, one on the floor shot through the head and the
other two near done in. Two of them had set on the
guy that was dead; but they hadn’t knocked him out
before he began to shoot, and he’d pretty well riddled
them with a Colt automatic pistol—”</p>

<p>“Them’s the things!” said Jude. “I’m savin’ up to
buy one of them things on my own—twenty-five dollars—”</p>

<p>“Shut your head! Then they must have knocked it
out of his hand and used the last shot on him.”</p>

<p>“His brains were all over the floor,” said Jude with
relish. “Pap said they looked like white of egg beat up
and enough to fill a puddin’ basin.”</p>

<p>“Pap spotted somethin’ else on the floor,” went on
Satan, “a piece of paper folded double. He put it in
his pocket while the fellers were bein’ lifted to the hospital,
where they died that same night. He was on the
square all right, takin’ that paper, and I’ll tell you why.
Six months before that we’d spotted a wreck comin’ up
from Guadaloupe. She’s so placed—as maybe you’ll see
yourself one day—that a hundred ships might have
passed her without spottin’ her, and bein’ out of trade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
tracks made her all the safer. These guys had been
talkin’ about a wreck before they left the bar for the
back room, and he reckoned it was our find they were
onto. The piece of paper made him sure of that, and,
takin’ it with the talk he’d heard, he reckoned he had
got the biggest thing that ever humped itself in these
waters. He said there was a hundred thousand dollars
aboard her.”</p>

<p>It was a fascinating story, yet it seemed to Ratcliffe
that Satan showed little enthusiasm over the business.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem very keen about it,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “it seems a bit too big, and that’s
the truth. The hooker’s there right enough, but I don’t
seem to see all that stuff aboard of her.”</p>

<p>“It’s there right enough,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Then there’s the getting of it,” went on Satan.
“That’s a tough job to tackle. Months of work, no pay,
and the chance of bein’ let down at the end of it.”</p>

<p>“Satan’d sooner be grubbin’ round after abalones,” said
Jude. “Bone lazy, that’s what he is! I know the stuff’s
there, and I’m goin’ to get it if I have to dig it out
myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, off with you then,” said the other, “and a good
riddance you’d be!” Then to Ratcliffe, “We’ll run you
down there some day and you can see for yourself. If
you’ve any money to burn, you might like to put it in the
spec’. We’d want extra help. Jude’s talkin’ through
her hat. We can’t tackle that business alone, even Pap
saw that—though he was mighty set on doin’ it single-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>handed.
And that’s where the bother comes in, for the
island where she’s lyin’ is Spanish, and the Dagoes would
claim what we got if they knew.”</p>

<p>“We’d have to get half a dozen men and give them
a share,” said Ratcliffe. “That would make them hold
their tongues; but I see an awful lot of difficulties. Suppose
you got the stuff, how are you to get rid of it?”</p>

<p>“We’d have to get it down to a Brazil port,” said
Satan, “or run it into Caracas. That’s handier. Them
Venezuelans are the handiest chaps when it comes to
loose dealin’.”</p>

<p>“For the matter of that,” said Ratcliffe, “one could
run it straight to England. There are lots of places
there where we could get it ashore—but we’ve got to
get it first.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Satan. “Look! She’s puttin’ a boat
off.” He pointed to the <i>Dryad</i>.</p>

<p>A quarter-boat had been lowered and was pulling
away from the yacht. As she drew closer Ratcliffe saw
that the man in the sternsheets, steering, was Skelton,—Skelton
coming either to make trouble or to make friends.</p>

<p>The oars rose up and fell with a crash as the bow oar
hooked on to the dingy old <i>Sarah</i>.</p>

<p>“Hulloo!” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Hulloo!” said Skelton.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come on board?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.” A sniff from Jude. “I just came
over to say that we are starting.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe saw that he wanted to say a lot, but was
tongue-tied before the boat’s crew and the Tylers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
“Better come on board,” said he, “and have a chat in
the cabin before you’re off.”</p>

<p>Skelton hesitated a moment, then he came. He gave
Satan a nod, utterly ignored Jude, and, followed by Ratcliffe,
passed below. Downstairs his manner changed.
Standing and refusing a seat, as though fearing to contaminate
his lily-white ducks, he began to speak as if
addressing the portrait of old man Tyler.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you absolutely mean to do this,” said
he. “I can understand a moment’s temper, but—but—this
is a joke carried too far.”</p>

<p>“My dear Skelton,” said the other, “what’s the good?
I have the greatest respect for you, but we are dead
opposites in temperament and we make each other
unhappy. What’s the good of carrying it on? It’s
not as if you minded being alone. You like being
alone, and I like this old tub and her crew. Well, let’s
each carry out our likings. I’m as happy as anything
here.”</p>

<p>“I’m not thinking of your happiness, but of the position.
You were a guest on my yacht, and you leave me
like this—I need not embroider on the bare fact.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to go back?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” said Skelton. “You are a free
agent, I hope.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe’s blood was beginning to rise in temperature.
He knew quite well Skelton wanted him to go back, but
was too proud to say so, and he knew quite well that
Skelton wanted him back, not for any love of him, but
simply because the <em>position</em> was irregular and people, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
they heard of all this, might talk; also it might seem
queer to the yacht’s crew.</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you don’t specially want me back, I’ll
stay,” said he.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Skelton, “as you please. I wash my
hands of the affair, and if you come to grief it is your
own lookout. I will have the remainder of your baggage
forwarded home to you when I reach England.”</p>

<p>“I’ll maybe see you at Havana when this cruise is
over,” said Ratcliffe vaguely.</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” said Skelton. “It is quite possible I may
not call there.” He turned and began to climb the companionway.
On deck he nodded frigidly to Satan and got
over the side.</p>

<p>Satan, leaning across the rail, looked down.</p>

<p>“How about that mains’l?” asked Satan jocularly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I have no more spare canvas available,”
said Skelton, with a veiled dig at the rapacity of the
lantern-jawed one, “or provisions. Anything else I shall
be delighted to let you have.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Satan, “you might send us a loan of
the dinghy. We’re short of boats.”</p>

<p>“You shall have her,” said Skelton with a glance at
Ratcliffe, who was also leaning over, as though to say,
“This is the sort of man you have thrown your lot in
with!”</p>

<p>The boat pushed off.</p>

<p>“Goodby!” cried Ratcliffe, half laughing, half angry,
with Satan, but quite unable to veto the promised gift.</p>

<p>“’By,” replied the other, raising a hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Jude, who had said not one word, suddenly began to
giggle.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with you?” asked Satan.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” replied Jude, “but there’s somethin’ about
that guy that makes me want to laugh.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">SKELTON SAILS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> breeze had risen with the declining sun and the
water round the <i>Dryad</i> looked like a spread of
smashed sapphires.</p>

<p>They watched Skelton getting on board, and then they
saw the dinghy lowered and the quarter-boat taking her
in tow. In five minutes, like a white duckling behind
a moor-hen, she was streaming on a line behind the <i>Sarah</i>
and the quarter-boat was pulling back for the yacht.</p>

<p>Satan had got his wish, and Ratcliffe was feeling just
as Skelton wanted him to feel, under a compliment and
rather a beast. Then they saw the boat taken on board
and the hands laying aloft and the canvas shaking out
to the favoring breeze.</p>

<p>“He’ll have the wind right aft, and that’ll save his
coal,” said Satan. “I reckon if his engines give out he
wouldn’t bother much, with all that canvas to carry him.”</p>

<p>“They’re handlin’ it smart,” said Jude. “There’s the
anchor goin’ up.”</p>

<p>The flurried sound of the steam winch raising the
anchor came across the water, then it ceased, and Jude,
running to the flag locker, fetched out a dingy old American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
flag, bent it on, and ran it up, dipping it as the <i>Dryad</i>
began to move.</p>

<p>She returned the compliment, gliding away with the
bow-wash beginning to show and the wake creaming behind
her. As she passed the southern reefs and shifted
her helm, squaring her yards to the following wind, a
blast from her siren raised a blanket of shouting gulls.
Then the island cut her off and the sea lay desolate.</p>

<p>The sense of his loneliness came on Ratcliffe, sudden
as the clap of a door. He had cut the painter with
civilization. The deck of the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> seemed smaller
than ever, Jude and Satan more irresponsible and unaccountable,
and his own daring a new thing, somewhat
dubious. He had renounced services and delicacies and
surety of passage and safety, letters and newspapers,
everything he had known! The shock scarcely lasted a
minute, and then, with the breeze across the pansy-blue
evening sea, came blowing the wind of Adventure and
Freedom.</p>

<p>Then in a moment some spirit explained to him what
life really meant,—life as the Argonauts knew it, as the
gulls know it, freedom in the intense and living moment,
without a thought of yesterday, with scarcely a care for
the morrow.</p>

<p>He took his seat in an old chair that Satan had placed
under the rag of awning and lit his pipe. That delightful
smoke seemed the culmination of everything in these
first moments in this new world. As he smoked he
watched the Tylers, who were so busy with their own
affairs that they seemed to have forgotten him. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
had hauled the dinghy alongside, then they got into her
and were lost to sight; but he could hear their voices,
Jude’s shrill with pleasure and excitement.</p>

<p>“My! Ain’t she a beauty? Ain’t she a dinky boat?
My! look at the <em>cus</em>hions!” A laugh. “For the love
of Mike look at the cushions—<em>cus</em>hions in a boat! Heave
’em on deck!” The cushions came flying over the rail,
together with the voice of Satan, evidently bending.</p>

<p>“Leave them alone or I’ll bat y’ with the bailer! Well,
let them lay on deck if they’re there. She’s a duck,
new built too,—teak, copper fastenin’s, all the best that
money could buy. Stop rockin’ her and over you get
after the cushions.”</p>

<p>Jude came clambering on board, beaming in the sunset,
then she got one of the boat’s cushions and took her
seat on it on the deck beside Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“I reckon old Popplecock’s as soft as his cushions, to
be wangled out of a boat like that,” said Jude, examining
the sole of her bare right foot for a fancied splinter.
“Satan said he was goin’ to try it on him when you were
down below with him. Didn’t believe he’d do it. That
chap looked as stiff as his own mainmast—but there’s no
tellin’—Say, I heard what you said to him when you
were down below.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t listenin’: I just heard through the skylight.
I heard you sayin’ you liked us and the old <i>Sarah</i> better’n
him and his boat—what makes likin’s?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
“Nuther do I; but we took to you right off, same as
you to us. Ever done abalone fishin’?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you won’t want to do it again, once
you’ve tried. There’ll be a big low tide tomorrow after
sun-up, and you’ll have a chance of seein’ what it is.
Finished your pipe? Well, come along and help us to
get supper.”</p>

<p>For all the work Ratcliffe did, she might have got the
supper herself. He was mostly in the way; but it was
the companionship that helped. Brothers aren’t much
good as companions. Ratcliffe was a new thing, absolutely
new, from his striped pajamas and dandy clothes to his
condition of mind, just as she was a new thing to Ratcliffe.
Never did two beings come together so well or
create more rapidly a little world of mutual interests out
of the little things of life, or a weaker being dominate
more completely the stronger.</p>

<p>“Can you make bread?” asked Jude after he had filled
the tin kettle for her. “Well, you’ll have to learn.
That’s the bakin’ powder in that big tin, and the flour’s
in the starboard locker—What’re you doin’ with the
tin? Land’s sake! You don’t think I’m goin’ to make
bread for supper, same as you make tea? Where was
you born?”</p>

<p>“Hampshire.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was somewhere like that,” said Jude.</p>

<p>She instructed him in the primitive method of bread
making as conducted on board the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>, finishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
up with the information that hardtack would be their portion
at supper that night and breakfast next morning, as
she was “up to the gunnel” in other business. Among
the other things was having to put a patch on her
trousers: not the ones she was wearing, which were her
next best, but her worst. The old guernsey she was
wearing was her second best. Coats! Oh, coats were
good enough on Sunday or for going ashore in, but no
use much in a ship, except an oilskin for dirty weather.
Boots the same; stockings the same. You had to wear
boots, of course, over rocks and through stuff like that
over there on the island.</p>

<p>“Them pajamas” would be bully things to wear by day,
only they’d frighten the fish. As for sleeping in such
things, she’d just as soon seek the arms of Morpheus
in a top hat. Why didn’t he wear a nighty like her and
Satan? Pap’s eyes would have bugged out had he seen
those things. He was “awful old fashioned,”—used to
make her and Satan put cotton between their teeth every
night. They did it still. She exhibited a set of dazzling
white teeth to prove the fact. You just pulled a cotton
thread between them, and then they never went rotten.
Also he made them brush their teeth every morning.
Folks that didn’t do that got toothache.</p>

<p>“Kettle’s boilin’,” suddenly finished Jude. “Now start
in an’ let’s see you make the tea—said you could do it.
There’s the can. Ain’t you goin’ to heat the pot first?
How’re you to heat it? Let me have a hold. Now fling
the water out. A spoonful a head and one for the pot
and another one for Satan,—he likes it strong,—and if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
you’ll take it along to the cabin without spillin’ it I’ll be
after you in a minute with the plates and things.”</p>

<p>Satan, who never put his hand to menial work, maintaining,
without the least offense, his position as captain
and owner, came down to supper, flushed with the good
qualities of the dinghy. He had taken her for a row—and
it was like hearing a man talking of a stroll with a
sweetheart—if men ever talk of such things. Before
going on deck to smoke he pointed out Ratcliffe’s quarters
for the night. He was to have Pap’s cabin, the
space divided off with a curtain. Jude and he always
slept in hammocks swung in the “saloon.” Before going
on deck he fetched an old canister out of a locker and,
emptying some dried herbs into a saucer, set fire to them
and left them smoldering on the table. It was to keep
the mosquitoes away. Pap had got the receipt from a
Seminole Indian up near Cedar Cays. It was patent
stuff. Not a mosquito would come when there was a
sniff of it in the air.</p>

<p>Then, just as the moon was rising, and after the things
were washed up, they sat on deck, smoking, listening to
the waves on the beach, and watching fish jumping in
the track of the moon. They talked of fish, and to Ratcliffe’s
mind two things became apparent,—Satan’s profound,
awful knowledge of the sea and all that lived
therein, and his absolute indifference to sport. Satan
fished for food. Tarpon and tarpon fishermen filled him
with disgust and disdain. You can’t eat tarpon, and the
guys that came from New York and such places and
spent their days fighting tarpon with a ten-ounce rod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and a twenty-one-thread line seemed to him bereft of
reason.</p>

<p>Jude, sitting on the deck and mending her pants by
the light of the moon, concurred.</p>

<p>“But it’s the fun of the thing,” said Ratcliffe; “it’s
the matching of one’s skill and strength against the fish.”
He talked of the joys of salmon fishing.</p>

<p>“What bait do you use for them?” asked Satan.</p>

<p>“Flies.”</p>

<p>Jude shrieked.</p>

<p>“Not live flies,” he explained: “imitation ones.” He
tried to describe artificial fly-making and finished with a
sense of failure as of one who had entered the lists in
defense of a niggling form of business that had yet a
touch of humor in it.</p>

<p>Then, as they talked, suddenly through the night came
a sound like the boom of a big gun. Ratcliffe nearly
dropped his pipe.</p>

<p>“That’s a fish,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Sea bat,” said Jude indifferently.</p>

<p>“That noise?”</p>

<p>“Sea bat jumping. There they go again. Must be a
circus of them playin’ about beyond the reefs,—big flat
fish, weigh all of a ton.”</p>

<p>“Tails as long as themselves and eyes like dinner
plates,” said Jude, “mushy brutes. Tow a ship after
them if they foul the anchor—won’t they, Satan?”</p>

<p>“They’re loudenin’,” said Satan. “They’ll be comin’
this way with the current. Come forward and have a
look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Leaning over the rail, they watched the moon-shot
water. The sounds had ceased.</p>

<p>“They’ve stopped playin’,” said Satan, as though he
knew exactly what they were doing.</p>

<p>“It’s too shallow for them here,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Shallow! It’s fifty foot of water and a sandy bottom.
What are you talkin’ about? Told you.”</p>

<p>The depths of the sea suddenly became lit. Down below
vast forms came drifting like the mainsails of ships
ablaze with phosphorescent light, drifting and turning
over as they drifted like gargantuan leaves blown by the
wind. The whiplike tails could be seen as streaks of
flame. Glimpses of devilish faces and lambent eyes
showed as they turned, the fins waving like frills of
fire.</p>

<p>Then they were gone.</p>

<p>The Tylers showed little concern over the marvelous
sight; allowing, however, that it was the biggest school
of “bats” they had ever struck; but to Ratcliffe it was
as though the sea had disclosed a peep of its true heart
and real mystery.</p>

<p>Then they went to rest, and as he lay in Pap’s cabin,
listening to the occasional trickle of the water against the
planking and the groan of the rudder moved by the lilt
of the swell, it seemed to him that daring in its everyday
and cold-blooded form could not have carried a man
much further than it had carried him. The sea bats had
underscored the business as far as the mystery of the
ocean and danger of cruising in such a small boat were
concerned; the hardness of Pap’s bunk bedding told of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
comforts renounced; while the morals of the Tylers,
though good enough no doubt, had, as disclosed in their
conversation, a touch of the free lance and a threat of
port authority troubles and differences of opinion with
the customs. Absolute respect for the rights of man,
partial respect for the rights of shipping companies and
steamer lines, no respect at all for governments and customs,—that
was an outline of the Tyler morality. What
had made him renounce the <i>Dryad</i> for the <i>Sarah?</i>
What, lying in his hard bunk, made him contented with
the exchange? The love of adventure and the craving
for something new contributed, no doubt, but the main
reason he felt to be the Tylers,—Satan with his strange
mentality and queer methods; Jude, unlike any other being
he had ever met.</p>

<p>Then, as he lay considering all this, came muted voices
from the “saloon.” Satan’s voice:</p>

<p>“Have you put the cotton between your teeth?”</p>

<p>Then Jude’s, drowsily:</p>

<p>“Naw—leave a body alone!”</p>

<p>“Get out o’ your hammock, you lazy dog, an’ fix your
teeth or I’ll let you down by the head!”</p>

<p>Then Jude’s voice, dolorous and muffled, “Shut up or
you’ll be wakin’ him! Cuss my teeth—cayn’t find the
cotton! Wakin’ a body up like that! Tell you I’m
<em>lookin’</em> for it—got it—”</p>

<p>A long silence, during which Ratcliffe dropped off,
to be awakened an hour later by the lamentations of Jude
and the sounds of Satan prodding her out of a nightmare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>—a
gastric nightmare, in which it appeared to her
troubled soul that she <em>had</em> to fry a sea bat, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">totum terres
atque rotundum</i>, in the small galley frying pan for breakfast.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">CARQUINEZ</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> tide had begun to draw out with the setting
stars, and the tune of the waters on the beach had
sunk to the merest thread of sound.</p>

<p>Then, through the silence from the far reefs to southward,
came the single, lamentable cry of a gull; then a
chorus, and away against the vague blue of the east, here
and there, like leaves blown about a dimly lit window
showed the wings of the birds already putting out to sea
for the fishing.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe was awakened by Jude calling on him to
“show a leg.”</p>

<p>“Satan’s on deck,” said Jude, “and if you believe in
washin’ he’ll give you a swill with a bucket. Hurry up
and come down again, for I want a swill myself. Swim?
Not on your life! Sharks, that’s why.”</p>

<p>The voice came from a hammock which he had
blundered against in the semidarkness. Then on deck
after his swill, drying himself with an old towel provided
by Satan, he stood for a moment watching the sun break
up through the water and the great sea flashing to life
and the white gulls flying.</p>

<p>The island was sending a faint breeze to them, a tepid
breeze flavored with earth and cactus and bay cedar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
scents, perfumes that mixed with the tang of the ocean
and the tar-oakum scents of the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>.</p>

<p>And all these scents and sounds and sights, from the
sun flash on the sea to the trembling palm fronds on
the shore, seemed like a great bouquet presented by
youth and morning.</p>

<p>Oh, the splendor of being alive, free, happy, without a
single care, and the deck of the wandering <i>Sarah</i> under
foot!</p>

<p>From below through the skylight came a sleep-heavy
voice.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you done yet?”</p>

<p>“Coming,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>He dived into his pajamas and came below.</p>

<p>“Get into your cabin an’ shut the door,” commanded
the yawning voice from the hammock.</p>

<p>“There’s no door.”</p>

<p>“Well, draw the curtain. Oh, Lord! what’s the good
o’ gettin’ up? I’m near dead asleep!”</p>

<p>Then the voice of Satan descending the companion
ladder.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you up? Well, you wait one minute!”</p>

<p>A thump on the floor, a scurry up the companion
ladder, and then shuddery lamentations and the sounds
of swilling from the deck above, mixed with the admonitions
of Satan from below.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! ain’t it cold? Oh, my! ain’t it frizzin’?”</p>

<p>“Get on, you mad turkle! You ain’t washin’, you’re
splashing the water on the deck. Slush it over you.”</p>

<p>“I’m slushing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
“Think I don’t know? Why, you ain’t gasped yet!
Give a gasp, or I’ll be up to you with a rope-end! That’s
more like it.”</p>

<p>It was!</p>

<p>The sun was high when Ratcliffe got on deck, and a
light, steady breeze was blowing up from the straits of
Florida; the gulls looked like snowflakes blowing round
the far reefs and against the morning blue of the sea.</p>

<p>Jude had put the kettle on. She had dressed on deck,
having carried her “togs” with her, and she was now preparing
a line for fishing, and, as she bent over it, appeared
Satan,—Satan rising from the cabin hatch with a
toothbrush in his hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve forgot your teeth,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” said Jude. “I’ve been fillin’ the kettle—I’ll
fix them when I’ve done with the fishin’.”</p>

<p>“Fishin’ will wait.” He fetched a pannikin of water.
“You’re more trouble than a dozen. What’d Pap say if
he saw you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix them when I’ve done with the fishin’.”</p>

<p>“You’ll fix them now!”</p>

<p>“No. I won’t!”</p>

<p>Satan put down the pannikin and the brush. She
evaded him like a flash and skimmed up the mast to the
crosstrees.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she got up than she came sliding down,
seized the toothbrush and pannikin, and began to brush
her teeth over the scupper with a fire speed and fury
that seemed born of dementia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“Sardines comin’,” explained Jude between mouthfuls.
“Look alive and get a bucket!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe looked over the sea, where her birdlike sight
had spotted the sardine shoal being driven like a gray
cloud under the water by pursuing fish. A fringe of
dancing silver showed the leaping sardines, and the great
fish driving the shoal broke up now and then in sword-flashes.</p>

<p>They were coming from south to north, and the left
wing of the shoal would pass the island beach by a cable
length.</p>

<p>While Satan stood by with a bucket at the end of a
rope, Ratcliffe hung over the side watching.</p>

<p>The driven sardines had no eyes for the <i>Sarah</i>. They
struck her like the blow of a great silvery hand, boiled
around her, and passed. The army of pursuit followed,
passed and vanished, leaving the water clear and Satan
with a dipped up bucket full of quivering silver.</p>

<p>The Tylers, absolutely blind to the wonder of the business,
fried the sardines just as they were, tossed out of
the blue sea into the frying pan, and, breakfast over,
Satan and Ratcliffe took the dinghy to hunt for abalones
on the uncovered reef.</p>

<p>The reefs to southward formed two spurs divided by
a creek of blue water, and having got the dinghy into
this creek Ratcliffe tended the boat while Satan hunted
for the abalones.</p>

<p>Satan in search of pearls was a sight. Heart, soul,
and mind bound up in the business, like a dog hunting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
for truffles, every find was announced by a yell or a
whoop, like the whoop of a Red Indian.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe could see squiggly-wiggly cuttlefish tendrils
running up Satan’s arms as he delved in some of the
rock-clefts, and Satan disengaging them and flinging the
“mushy brutes” away. The big abalones were nearly always
deep down under the rock ledges and had to be
chiseled off, wallowing in the water. At these times Ratcliffe
might have fancied the vanished one lost or
drowned, but for the profane language that rose and
floated away on the breeze.</p>

<p>All the same, it was dull work for the boat tender.
Having nothing else to think of, he thought of Jude.
Her figure chased away dullness.</p>

<p>A man in the bright and early morning is quite a different
person from the same man at noon, and coming
across Jude after a long course of Skelton was like stepping
from a gray afternoon to dawn. Was it possible
that Skelton and Jude were vertebrates of the same
species?</p>

<p>Then there was what women would have called the
pity of it. Ratcliffe did not deal much with the conventions
as a rule; still, he could not but perceive that all
life has an aim and ending, and that the end of an old
sailor was not what life and the fitness of things had
destined for Jude. What would she grow up into? He
thought of all the girls he had ever known. There was
not one so jolly as Jude; still, it was terrible, somehow,
monstrous. He remembered her threat to pull her skirts
over her head and run down the street if skirts were ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
imposed upon her. Her contempt for the feminine rose
up before him, and against all that her housewifely instincts
and the fact that, despite Satan’s rope-end and
mock bluster, she ruled the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> just as a woman
rules a house.</p>

<p>Still, it was deplorable. Looking away into distance,
what would become of her?</p>

<p>Vague and fatherly ideas of getting her away from
this life and having her brought up properly and educated
came to him, only to be dispelled by Jude. Imagine Jude
in a girls’ school, at a tea party!</p>

<p>He was aroused from these meditations by Satan,—Satan
with an armful of abalones, Satan scratched and
bleeding and soused in sea water, but triumphant.</p>

<p>He reckoned they were the biggest “fish” ever got on
these reefs. There were a dozen and six all told, and
when they were collected and put on board the dinghy
put back.</p>

<p>Coming round the western spur of the reef, they found
that Jude had left the <i>Sarah</i>—a high crime—and rowed
herself ashore.</p>

<p>The canvas boat was on the beach, and away amid the
bay cedars and cactus toward the trees could be seen
the head and shoulders of the deserter moving about.
She seemed in search of something.</p>

<p>“God love me!” cried Satan.</p>

<p>He beached the dinghy, helped Ratcliffe to run her up,
and then started, followed by the other, running and
shouting as he ran.</p>

<p>“Hi! chucklehead! Whatcha leave the ship for?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Didn’t I tell you to stand by her? Whatcha huntin’ for—turkles’
eggs?”</p>

<p>“What you done with your eyes?” retorted the other.
“Cayn’t you see?”</p>

<p>Instantly, and by her tone and by some sixth sense,
Satan was appeased. He seemed suddenly to scent danger.
He saw the work she had been on, camouflaging
the cache more effectively. He cast his glance over the
island, the western sea, turned, and then stood stock-still,
shading his eyes.</p>

<p>Away beyond the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> across the purple blue
stood a sail. The land wind had died off, and the
stranger was bringing the sea wind with her. A small
topsail schooner she showed now, with all sail set, making
dead for the island.</p>

<p>“That’s him,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Spotted him half an hour ago,” said Jude. “He was
steering nor’-nor’west and shifted his helm when he saw
us.”</p>

<p>The bay cedar bushes sighed suddenly to the new-risen
wind, and as Ratcliffe glanced about him the feeling of
the desolation of the place where he stood came to him
strong,—strong in the scent of cactus and herbage, the
tune of the water on the beach, and the rustle of the
wind in the bushes.</p>

<p>“He’s been huntin’ for us,” said Satan, “curse him!”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Friend of Pap’s, he was—”</p>

<p>“Pretended to be,” put in Jude.</p>

<p>“Spanish,” continued Satan, “and ever since Pap gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
out he’s been pretty much on our heels. Jude and me
worked the thing out and we came to conclude he’d
scented, somehow, from Pap, about the hooker I spoke
of.”</p>

<p>“The wreck?’</p>

<p>“Yep. Pap was keen on gettin’ extra money into the
business of salvin’ her, and I b’lieve he sounded
Carquinez,—that’s his name,—and how much he let out
takin’ his soundin’s the Lord only knows! Cark’s in the
tobacco line. Does a bit of everythin’,—has a shop in
the Calle Pedro in Havana and a gamblin’ joint on the
front, owns ships. That’s one of them, and Matt Sellers
runs her for him. He don’t trouble handlin’ her: sits
in the cabin all day smokin’ cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“He’s been after us ever since Pap died,” said Jude,
“on and off.”</p>

<p>“It was one of his men got Jude in that doggery down
by the wharf and filled her up with rum,” said Satan,
turning the brim of his panama down. “Remember I
told you—and what she let out the Lord only knows!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t let out nothin’,” said Jude; “only that we were
goin’ east this trip, I owns to that.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the result of your jaw,” said Satan.
“East was good enough for Cark: he’d hunt hell for a
red cent. And don’t you be sayin’ you didn’t let out
nothin’. Why, I heard you jawin’ about all the money
you had when I come in and collared you! Cark believes
Pap found that stuff and cached it—that’s what he believes,
or my name’s not Tyler.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get aboard,” said Jude. “If they see us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
squatting about here, they’ll maybe think the stuff’s hid
here.”</p>

<p>“They’ve seen us by this, though it’s too far for them
to make out who we are,” said Satan, pushing his panama
farther forward to hide his face. He led the way to
where the boats were on the sand, and they reëmbarked.</p>

<p>The abalones were got on board, and then they stood
watching the approach of the stranger.</p>

<p>The white had gone out of her sails. Close in now,
they showed dingy and patched. She had a low freeboard.
Then, as she dropped anchor and swung to her
moorings broadside on to the <i>Sarah</i>, the rake of her masts
became apparent, and her whole disreputableness spoke
aloud.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe felt like a man who, having got into pleasant
low company, suddenly finds himself drawn into unpleasant
low company.</p>

<p>The <i>Tylers</i> and the old <i>Sarah</i> were all right, but this
new crowd and that ratty old schooner he felt to be all
wrong. And the newcomer somehow did not add honesty
or moral stability to the appearance of the <i>Sarah</i>, nor did
the half-disclosed character and activities of Cark shed
luster on old man Tyler or his present representatives.</p>

<p>However, he had gone into this business open-eyed,
and it was not for him to grumble at the friends or relationships
of his hosts; besides he had trust in Satan
and the wit of Satan to preserve them from the law.</p>

<p>Satan had covered the heap of abalones with some sail-cloth,
and he was standing now working his lantern jaws
on a bit of chewing gum, his eyes fixed on the stranger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
as though she were made of glass and he could see
Carquinez sitting smoking his cigarettes in the cabin.</p>

<p>“They haven’t shown a sign,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“They’re bluffin’ us to believe they haven’t spotted who
we are,” said Satan. “Cark doesn’t want us to twig he’s
been lookin’ for us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jude, “let’s get the mud-hook up and
put out right away. They won’t have the face to chase
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Satan, “and leave them to hunt the island
and find the cache! They’d lift the stuff to the last tin
of beef. They’ve seen us ashore among the bushes.
You shouldn’t have gone ashore.”</p>

<p>“I went to see we hadn’t left no traces.”</p>

<p>“Traces be damned! Cark wants no traces. Once he
starts to hunt, he’ll turn the durned island upside down
and shake it. He’ll say to himself, ‘What were they doin’
here, anyway; what were they pokin’ about them bushes
for?’ No, we’ve got to sit here till he goes, and that’ll
be this time next year, maybe.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of his schooner?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“The <i>Juan Bango</i>,” replied Satan, “named after the
tobacco company people. Look, they’re gettin’ a boat off.
That’s Sellers, and he’s comin’ aboard.”</p>

<p>Then he collapsed, squatting under the bulwarks.
“Guy them,” said he to Jude. “Tell them I’m down with
smallpox: that’ll make them shove.”</p>

<p>“Leave ’em to me,” said Jude.</p>

<p>It was Matt Sellers right enough, a big wheezy man
suggestive of Tammany Hall, but a sure-enough sailor in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
practice. “The biggest blackguard on the coast” was his
subsidiary title. He was the henchman of Carquinez.
His career was not without interest and romance of a
sort. It was he who had bought, with the money of
Carquinez, the bones of the <i>Isidore</i>, wrecked against the
sheer cliffs by the black strand of Martinique. Ten
thousand dollars in gold coin she had on board her, and
he salved them. That was a straight job, and a wonderful
bit of work, taking it all together. It was a curiosity,
too, because it was straight.</p>

<p>The crooked jobs of Matt Sellers would have filled a
book.</p>

<p>Like old man Tyler, Sellers had no use for people who
talked of buried treasure, he knew the Caribbean and the
gulf too well.</p>

<p>If he was keen on the wreck business, then it was because
he had excellent reasons for his keenness.</p>

<p>As the boat drew near, Ratcliffe noticed the villainous-looking
crew, Spaniards, some of them with red handkerchiefs
tied round their heads.</p>

<span class="subhead">JUDE OVERDOES IT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“Hullo,</span> Kid!” cried Sellers as the boat came
alongside the <i>Sarah</i>.</p>

<p>“Hullo, yourself,” replied Jude. “Where’ve you blown
in from?”</p>

<p>“What’s become of Satan? Ain’t he aboard?” asked
Sellers, ignoring the question.</p>

<p>“Satan’s dead,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Satan’s which?”</p>

<p>“Died of the smallpox.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m d—d!” said Sellers, casting his eyes over
the <i>Sarah</i> and then resting them on Ratcliffe. “When
was it?”</p>

<p>“A week ago.”</p>

<p>Sellers gave a word to the bow oar and the boat pushed
off a bit, the fellows hanging on their oars.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw three of you on deck,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“The other chap’s gone below,” replied Jude.</p>

<p>The boat of the <i>Juan</i> hung for a moment as if in meditation.
She made a striking picture, the blue water
paling to green under her and the sun-blaze on the red
topknots of the oarsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Then without a word more she turned back to the
<i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>Satan in the scupper seemed preparing to have a fit.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What did you say I was dead
for? Didn’t I tell you to say I was down with smallpox?”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Why, you mutt, wouldn’t you have been snivelin’ and
cryin’ if I was dead? And you handed that yam out to
him as ca’m as if you were talking of a tomcat! I didn’t
believe you myself.”</p>

<p>“Why, I told him you was dead a week,” cried Jude.
“D’you think I’d be snivelin’ and cryin’ a week if you
was dead? Lord! what you do think of yourself!”</p>

<p>Satan did not reply. He was thinking that he had
made a false move and that Jude had put the cap on the
business. Cark would be certain now that there was
something hidden on the island.</p>

<p>Satan was on the horns of a dilemma. One horn was
the cache of provisions containing a couple of thousand
dollars’ worth of stuff, the other horn was the old wreck
that might contain nothing.</p>

<p>To hang on here was useless, for Cark would hang on
too. Even if Cark went away, he would be sure to come
back to hunt.</p>

<p>He sat with his back to the bulwarks, chewing and
thinking. Then, heedless whether he was seen or not
from the <i>Juan Bango</i>, he rose to his feet and leaned with
his back against the rail He had come to a decision.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Jude, watching him, said nothing, and Ratcliffe waited
without a word. This little sea comedy interested him
intensely, and all the more for its setting of loneliness and
its background of blue sea and quarreling gulls.</p>

<p>It was to Ratcliffe that Satan spoke first
“Look here!” said Satan. “You’re standin’ out of this,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Which—the wreck business?”</p>

<p>“Yep. You’re not keen upon puttin’ money into it and
havin’ a share?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. If you wanted me to, I’d be glad enough;
but if you’d rather I stood out, I’ll do so. I’m not keen
about money, anyway; only I’d like to see the fun.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see fun enough,” said Satan. “I’m goin’ to
drag Cark in. First of all, if I don’t, he’ll keep hangin’
round here and sniff the cache; second, he’ll work the
job for us with his crew.”</p>

<p>“He’ll gobble every cent,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Satan. “We’ll give him half
shares, and well split on him if he doesn’t play fair. If
we found stuff there, and once it was known, d’you think
we’d be let keep it? We’ve got to get help, and isn’t he
as good as another? If there’s no stuff there, he’ll have
all his work for nothing.”</p>

<p>“The thing I can’t make out,” said Ratcliffe, “is the
way he started out from Havana to find you. How did
he ever expect to come across you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way,” said Satan. “Bein’ in with Pap,
he knew the lines we worked on; f’rinstance, he knew
we worked this place for abalones. If he hadn’t sighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
as here; he’d have tried Little Pine Island, which is lonesomer
than this place. You see he’s got it in his noddle,
as far as I can make out, that Pap lifted the stuff and
cached it, and Pine Island or here would have been the
likeliest places. He reckoned when we put out of
Havana this time we were out to lift it for good. Well,
he’ll do the liftin’ if it’s to be done. Come on, I’m going
over to see him right off. Jude, you stick here and clean
up them abalones.”</p>

<p>He got into the dinghy, followed by Ratcliffe, and they
pushed off.</p>

<p>As they drew closer the <i>Juan Bango</i> showed up more
distinctly for what she was.</p>

<p>One of the old schooners that used to run in the carrying
trade between Havana and the Gulf ports, she had
fallen from commercial honesty; anyhow in appearance,
perhaps because Carquinez did not bother about appearance.
You could not have damaged his paint if you
had tried,—it was sun-blistered and gone green,—but his
copper showed sharp and clear through the amazing
brilliance of the water, without trace of weeds or barnacles.</p>

<p>Sellers was hanging over the rail as they came alongside.</p>

<p>If he felt surprise at this resurrection, he did not show
it much.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Satan!” cried Sellers. “Thought you was
dead.”</p>

<p>“Cark on board?” asked Satan without wasting time
on explanations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
“He’s down below,” said Sellers, accepting the attitude
of the other. “Who’s your friend?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a gentleman that’s come along for a cruise,”
said Satan. “So you’ve found me!”</p>

<p>“Seems so,” said Sellers; “but tie up and come aboard.”</p>

<p>Satan tied the painter to a channel plate and got over
the side, followed by Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>The deck of the <i>Juan</i> sagged, and plank and dowel were
indistinguishable one from the other by reason of dirt.
Forward some of the crew were scraping a spare boom,
and others collected round the foc’sle head were smoking
cigarettes. The wind had died out into a warm breathing,
setting aft and bringing with it a faint odor like the
smell of acetylene. It was garlic.</p>

<p>From the foc’sle came the muffled thrumming of a
guitar.</p>

<p>It was Ratcliffe’s first experience with a Spaniard.
He followed Satan, who followed Sellers down a steep
companionway and then into a cabin where a great shaft
of sunlight from the skylight above struck down through
a haze of cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>The place was paneled with bird’s-eye maple; the seats
were upholstered in thick ribbed silk, worn and stained;
the carpet was of the best, but threadbare in spots and
burnt with cigar droppings; the metal fittings far too
good for a trading schooner of the <i>Juan</i> type.</p>

<p>Everywhere lay evidence of splendor that had seen
better days.</p>

<p>All these fittings had, in fact, been torn out of a yacht
bought by Carquinez for an old song, and at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the saloon table, going over some papers with a cigarette
in his mouth, sat Carquinez himself, a figure to give one
pause.</p>

<p>The whole of the left side of this gentleman’s face was
covered by a green patch. It was said that he had no
left side to his face, that it had been eaten away by
disease, and that, were he to unveil himself, the sight
would frighten the beholder. However that may have
been, what remained visible was enough to frighten any
honest man with eyes to behold the nose of a vulture
above the peaked chin of a money changer.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Cark!” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Cark.</p>

<p>“Bring yourselves to an anchor,” said Sellers, pointing
out two of the fixed seats on each side of the table and
taking another close to the owner of the <i>Juan</i>. “What’ll
you have?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Satan. “Something soft will
suit us, and long.”</p>

<p>Carquinez raised a bird-shrill voice:</p>

<p>“Antonio!”</p>

<p>“Si, Sigñor,” came a response from outside, and on
the voice a dusky form at the cabin door.</p>

<p>“Bring me two Zin and Zinzibeers for these two
zentlemen, please.”</p>

<p>“No gin!” cried Satan, Ratcliffe concurring. “Ginger
beer will do.”</p>

<p>“Zinzibeers,” said Carquinez.</p>

<p>It was nearly all that he said at this interview, the
trusty Sellers doing the talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Said Sellers to Satan, “Well, it’s funny us hittin’ on you
like this, durned funny! We’d been down to Acklin
looking up a location Cark was keen about, and comin’
back I shifted the helm, seein’ you lying here and not
recognizin’ the old <i>Sarah</i>. I thought it was Gundyman’s
boat.”</p>

<p>Said Satan, taking up the drink just presented by
Antonio, “Here’s our respects to you both. Thought I
was Gundyman, did you? Well, I spotted you on sight.
Didn’t want to see you neither. This gentleman will tell
you I was squattin’ in the scuppers while Jude was
handing you that lie about the smallpox.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was you?” said Sellers with an open and hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>“I was so. Let’s cut pretendin’ and play on the square—are
you willin’?”</p>

<p>“None better.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll put my cards out. You and Cark here have
been after me pretty near since last fall; reason why,
that wreck Pap told Cark of.”</p>

<p>“W’ich was that?”</p>

<p>“I said let’s cut pretendin’ and play fair,” said Satan
sternly.</p>

<p>Cark wilted and raised his fingers in deprecation, and
Sellers cut in.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll play fair. There was talk of a wreck between
your dad and us, and I’m not denying we had an
eye after it. You see I’m open and honest with you.
Heave ahead.”</p>

<p>“I’m comin’ to the point,” said Satan, “and the point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
is you and Cark between you have got it in your heads
that you’ve only to follow me, find out where she’s
located, and claim shares for not tellin’.”</p>

<p>“Heave ahead,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got it wrong,” went on Satan. “You
may follow me till the old <i>Juan</i> rots to pieces and you’ll
never know, not if I don’t want you to know—got that
clear?”</p>

<p>“Clear as day,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Well, then, here’s something else. If that wreck is
what she’s taken to be, it’s more than one man’s job to
shift the boodle and bank it. I’ve got to have help, and
if we can arrange a deal I’d just as soon have you two
in the show as anyone else.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>Carquinez said nothing, but his hand shook, and Ratcliffe,
watching him, received a shock. A wreath of
cigarette smoke was stealing out from beneath the patch
on his cheek! He wished the conference over and himself
back on board the healthy <i>Sarah</i>. It came to him all
at once that he had been drawn into a web of which
Carquinez was the spider. Satan, too, and Jude had been
drawn in. He could do nothing, however, at least for the
moment, but watch and wait, and Satan’s face was worth
watching as that wily diplomatist sat facing Sellers.</p>

<p>“Not that I don’t believe you’d kidoodle me over the
business if you had a chance,” continued Satan. “You
would, sure; but you see I’ve got the weather gauge of
you, knowing what I do of you, and that’s more’n I’d
have with strangers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
“Sure,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Satan, “we’ve got that far, and it
comes to terms. What’s your share to be for helpin’ to
collar the stuff and dispose of it in Havana?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars out of every three that we make,” said
Sellers promptly. “There’s the salving, you can’t do that
alone, or your dad would have done it prompt; then
there’s the cashing of it, you’re lost men if you try that
job on by yourselves. Why, there’s not another man in
Havana could do it only Cark, and even he couldn’t bring
the stuff into Havana Harbor! It’ll have to be landed
back of the island, north of Santiago. Lord knows what
he’ll have to pay!”</p>

<p>Satan cogitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you,” said he at last. “I’m not set on big
money. Anything more?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s all,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>Carquinez nodded approval, and lighting another
cigarette leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>“And what’s this gentleman doing in the business?”
asked Sellers, referring to Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s standing out,” said Satan. “He’s just on a
cruise with us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m standing out,” said Ratcliffe. “I’m in it only
for the fun of the thing, though I’m willing to help.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you’ll have fun enough,” said Sellers,
“if we get foul of the customs, or if some other hooker
comes poking along while we’re salving. You’re British,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
“I thought so. Come out for a spree?”</p>

<p>“You may put it like that.”</p>

<p>“Did you by any chance come off a big white yacht
that went west yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. What made you guess that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sellers, “it’s easy to be seen you aren’t
one of us, and your clothes give you away. It’s easy to
be seen you haven’t been dough-dishing long in the old
<i>Sarah</i>. I didn’t get your name.”</p>

<p>“Ratcliffe.”</p>

<p>“No trade or business?”</p>

<p>“None. My father was Ratcliffe the shipowner, Holt
&amp; Ratcliffe.”</p>

<p>“Lord—love—a—duck!” said Sellers. “You’re not
wanting for money, I reckon. Well, this gets me, it do
indeed! Holt &amp; Ratcliffe—should think I <em>did</em> know
them!”</p>

<p>“Antonio!” suddenly piped Carquinez.</p>

<p>“Si, Señor.” Antonio appeared.</p>

<p>“Pedro Murias,” said Carquinez.</p>

<p>Antonio vanished, and reappeared with a box of cigars,
colossal cigars, worth twenty-five guineas a hundred in
the London market. They were placed on the table and
pushed toward Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Satan grinned.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “we’ve fixed things so far,—two out
of every three dollars to you and no deductions.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“And now we’ve fixed terms,” said Satan, “I want to
know all about this hooker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
“Which was you meaning?” asked Sellers.</p>

<p>“The wreck.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” cried Sellers. “Mean to say you don’t
know all about her?”</p>

<p>“N’more than Adam. I’ve heard from Pap she was
called the <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, and was full of gold plate
got from churches; but that’s not much more than a name
and a yarn. I’ve never banked much on the yarn.
Seems too much of the New Jerusalem touch about it for
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’re wrong,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Spit it out,” said Satan. “Tell us what you know
about her. You’ve got the contrac’; give us the news.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Sellers. “She weren’t no
ship with gold plates,—your dad got that wrong,—she
was a big Spanish ship out of Vera Cruz making for
Spain. She had a cargo of timber, some of them heavy
foreign timbers that don’t float. She’d got aboard her,
besides the timber, more’n a million dollars’ worth of
gold,—Mexican gold most of it, Spanish coin some of it.
Lopez was the name of the skipper, and he laid to bank
that gold for himself. He’d been forty years in these
seas and knew every key and sandbank same as the insides
of his own pockets.</p>

<p>“Him and the mate were the only men in the know
about that gold beside a supercargo by name of Perez.</p>

<p>“Well, he colluded together with them two guys to
sink the hooker in six fathom water out of trade tracks,
give out that she’d sunk in a gale, and come back in a
year or two and collar the boodle. They had her bored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and plugged for the game, and when they got her to the
location they pulled out the plugs, and she went down
without a sneeze, natural as a dyin’ Christian.</p>

<p>“They got the boats away in order, and the crew was
got off to a man; but that crew never got ashore. Maybe
it was something wrong with the grub or the water,
there’s no saying, but they never got ashore to turn
witness. But the grub and water was all right in the
dinghy. Them three guys had taken the dinghy, and
they were picked up and landed somewhere on the gulf,
fat and well.”</p>

<p>All through Sellers’ recitation Carquinez had sat nodding
his head. He glanced now at Satan and Ratcliffe as
if measuring its effect upon them, then he half closed
his eyes again and retired into himself like a tortoise.</p>

<p>“They slung their yarn,” went on Sellers, “and made
all good, and it was only left for them to wait awhile
and hire or steal a likely boat to pick up the stuff, when
the yellow fever took the supercargo and the mate, leaving
Lopez to fish for himself.</p>

<p>“He got back to Havana, which was his natural home,
and there he put up with his son, who was a trader in
tobacco, got a bit of a factory not bigger than a henh’us,
and turned out a brand of cigars made out of leavin’s
and brown paper mostly.</p>

<p>“He put the son wise about the wreck; but he
wouldn’t give the location away till it was time to go
and pick up the stuff, which wouldn’t be for a year yet.</p>

<p>“Then he up and died, and the son started to hunt for
the chart and couldn’t find it. The old guy had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
him everything but the chart with the location marked on
it. It wasn’t a proper chart, neither: just a piece of
paper with the thing done rough, but giving the bearings.
And it was never found—not by the son. The grandson
found it—and where do you think? Pasted into the lining
of an old hat. That wasn’t so long ago, neither, and
what do you think that fool of a grandson did? Well,
I’ll tell you what he did. First of all he comes to Cark
here, and tries to get him onto the job on a ten per cent
basis, Cark to risk his money and repitation for a lousy
ten per cent on what might be only the bones of an old
ship. He let out her name and history and everything
but the location.</p>

<p>“Cark wasn’t having any on those terms,—was you,
Cark?—and he told the chap to go to Medicine Hat and
pick bilberries. The chap goes off, and what does he
do but tries to get up a syndicate between himself and
two yeggmen without a keel to their names! Perrira was
the name of one, and da Silva was the name of the other,
and they held a board meeting in Diego’s saloon one night
and shot holes in one another in the back parlor.</p>

<p>“Silva and Perrira had fixed it to lay the grandson
out and collar the chart for themselves, and they’d have
done it, only he wasn’t backward with the shooting.
Your dad was in the bar that night, and he twigged something
from what they let drop before they went to the
back parlor to hold their meeting. Then when the shooting
began he was first into the room, and collared the
chart, which was lying on the floor. He was always
quick on the uptake, was your dad. Being a knowledgeable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
man, he reckoned Cark was the only chap in
Havana to help him take the stuff and clear it. He
knew the stuff was there by what he’d heard going on in
the bar before the three chaps had left it for the back
room, but before he could conclude business with Cark
he up and died.”</p>

<p>Cark nodded.</p>

<p>“That was so,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “we’ve got the whole yarn now,
and I’m wishing to be done with the business. I’m pretty
near sick of you two guys trailing after me, and I’ll
hand you out my belief for what it’s worth. It don’t
seem natural to me to find gold in a hooker like that, just
for the picking up, and I’d sell any man my chances for
a thousand dollars. I’ve no knowledge of what’s there.
I’m just talkin’ out of my head. You know what I am,
I make my livin’, and I’m content to run small. It’s
maybe that that puts me against big ventures. Anyhow,
we’ve got to push this thing through, we’ve made the
contrac’. I don’t want it written down and signed, seein’
that the law couldn’t help me. I’m only sayin’ that if
you play me crooked I’ll split. Got that in your heads?”</p>

<p>The high contracting parties on the other side nodded
assent.</p>

<p>“That bein’ settled,” said Satan, “here’s the chart.”</p>

<p>He produced a metal tobacco box and took from it a
folded piece of paper, which he laid on the table before
Sellers.</p>

<p>The effect was magical.</p>

<p>Carquinez sprang from his chair like a young man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
came behind Sellers, and, bending over his shoulder,
looked. Ratcliffe, though out of the business, was as excited
as the others. Satan alone was calm.</p>

<p>He had been carrying the thing about so long that it
had probably lost its freshness of interest.</p>

<p>Sellers, without speaking, stared at the chart before
him.</p>

<p>Rum Cay was shown, and then, southwest of Rum Cay,
a line of reef marked “Lone Reef,” and in red ink, connected
to the reef by a red line, the name “Nombre de
Dios” could be made out, the “Dios” very indistinct at
the frayed edge of the paper. In the top right-hand corner
the latitude and longitude were written, but so faintly
that it would have required close study in a strong light
to make the figures out.</p>

<p>Nobody bothered about them. Lone Reef was on all
the charts, and the name was enough.</p>

<p>“I’ve been by there,” said Sellers at last, “and I’ve
never seen signs of a wreck.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” said Satan. “She lies flush with the
coral in a crik between two arms of reef, not a stump
of a mast on her. The hull of that reef must have raised
itself since she was sunk, for the water in the crik doesn’t
cover her at high tide and low tides it’s pretty near empty.
But she’s been under right enough, years ago, for the
decks are coraled over, hatches and all, and the stuff’s
turned to iron cement with the sun and weather. We’ve
got to dynamite her open.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Sellers; then, after a moment’s pause,
“It’ll be a big job, if it’s what you say. I had it in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
mind that she was a diving job in shallow water—never
thought of the blasted coral.”</p>

<p>Carquinez said nothing. He withdrew to his seat at
the end of the table and lit another cigarette. To Ratcliffe
the silence of Carquinez approached the weird.
The way Sellers, without consulting him, did all the talking
seemed uncanny as though the pair were telepathic.</p>

<p>One thing certain was gradually being borne in upon
him,—they were a most atrocious pair of rogues, and the
marvel to him was the simplicity of Satan in having any
dealings at all with them. They would surely swindle
him, take what precautions he might. They would never
give him a third share of any treasure. They would,
most likely, murder him before he could split on them, if
treasure were found. Of this Ratcliffe felt certain. He
tried to telegraph a warning across the table, but Satan
seemed blind to winks and frowns.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s there,” said Satan, “near a foot thick.
You’ve got to drill it, and stick dynamite cartridges in the
drill-holes and fire them. Got any dynamite aboard?”</p>

<p>“Not an ounce.”</p>

<p>“We might make out with blasting powder.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we’d got it,” said Sellers. “There ain’t no use
worrying, we’ve got to shin out of this back to Havana
and get the explosives. Question is who’ll go for them,
us or you?”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said Satan, “not if she was to lie there till
the last trumpet. We’re underhanded, for one thing, and,
f’r another, I’m gettin’ little enough out of the job as it
stands without fetchin’ and carryin’ for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
“Then we’ll go,” said Sellers. “’Twon’t take us more
than a week to get there and back. Give us ten days,
counting accidents, and we’ll pick you up here.”</p>

<p>“Why not at the reef?” asked Satan.</p>

<p>“Don’t matter,” said Sellers. “Here or there, it’s all
the same to us; ain’t it, Cark?”</p>

<p>Cark nodded assent, and Satan, recapturing the chart,
folded it up and put it back into the tobacco box.</p>

<p>“Right!” said he, placing the box into his pocket.
“Here you’ll find us.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE “JUAN” SAILS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">They</span> rose from the conference table, and Carquinez
stood holding his coat together with a veined and
knotted hand while the visitors were making their adieux.</p>

<p>“You haven’t a few feet of galvanized wire aboard?”
asked Satan as he passed out, following Sellers.</p>

<p>“Come on deck,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>On deck he stood listening, while the other passed from
galvanized wire to the question of spare ring-bolts and
other trifles he stood desperately in need of. Like a
hypnotized fowl in the hands of Satan, he made scarcely
any resistance.</p>

<p>He had no ring-bolts, but the galvanized wire was
forthcoming, also a little barrel for use as a buoy, some
Burgundy pitch, an old paintbrush, a small can of turpentine,
and a couple of pounds of twine.</p>

<p>A small boat-anchor that had raised Satan’s desires
brought the séance to a conclusion and broke the spell
that seemed to lie on Sellers.</p>

<p>Blessed if Satan wouldn’t be asking for his back teeth
yet! What did he take the <i>Juan</i> for, a marine store?
What would he want next, Carquinez?</p>

<p>They rowed off with the spoil, Sellers leaning on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
rail and lovingly pressing on them the acceptance of other
trifles, including a guitar.</p>

<p>Alongside the <i>Sarah</i> they found Jude waiting to receive
them. She had been cleaning up the abalones, was
dissatisfied with the result,—quarter of a matchbox full
of seed pearls,—and said so.</p>

<p>When her eye lighted on the stuff in the boat that
Satan had wangled out of Sellers, she laughed in a dreary
fashion.</p>

<p>“What you laughin’ at?” demanded Satan.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Jude.</p>

<p>She sat down on an upturned keg while they brought
the truck on board. Then, nursing her knee and wiggling
her bare toes to the warmth of the sun, she sat without
a word, waiting for explanations.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ratcliffe all at once that a critic had come
on the scene. He had forgotten Jude in relation to the
deal over the wreck, and he was wondering now how she
would take it. The female does not always see eye to eye
with the male, as many a business man has discovered
on revealing a transaction to the wife of his bosom.</p>

<p>Leaning against the rail, he filled his pipe and awaited
the revelation with interest; but Satan, the revealer,
seemed in no hurry for the business. He was bustling
about disposing of the new-gotten “stores,”—the turpentine
and pitch forward in the hole where paints were
kept, the galvanized wire in a locker, and the little barrel
behind the canvas boat.</p>

<p>Then he came aft again and, lighting a pipe, stood beside
Ratcliffe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
“Well, what you been doing, anyway?” asked Jude,
suddenly opening her batteries.</p>

<p>“Doing—which?” asked Satan. “Oh, you mean with
Cark. Well, I’ve settled things with him, fixed it up so’s
he’s goin’ to help.”</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“Why, to get the stuff, if it’s there—what else? He’s
our only chance of doing the thing proper.”</p>

<p>“What’s he askin’?” said Jude.</p>

<p>“You mean terms?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way: He’ll have to do the wreckin’
business, and then if the stuff’s got he’ll have to run it
ashore, and after that he’ll have to get rid of it. I’m
givin’ him two dollars out of every three.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” said Jude.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you give him the lot?”</p>

<p>“Now look you here!” cried Satan. “I don’t want no
sass! Who’s runnin’ this show, you or me? How do
you know what I’ve got up my sleeve? Have you ever
known me done on a deal yet? Now you take my orders
where Cark’s concerned and take them smart, with no
questions! If you don’t—well, then, trade with him
yourself, take charge of the <i>Sarah</i> and run her yourself!
Lippin’ your betters!”</p>

<p>Jude took off her old hat and looked into it as if for
inspiration; then she clapped it on her head again, drew
up both feet, clasped her arms round her knees, and sat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
on the keg-top speechless and brooding, her eyes fixed on
the <i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>Satan turned and went below.</p>

<p>“Jude,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“What you want?” said Jude, without shifting her
gaze.</p>

<p>“Suppose you had all the money off that old wreck, if
the money is there, what would you do with it?”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of askin’ me things like that?” said
Jude. “I’d precious soon do something with it!”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t. You’d put it in the bank, and then
your trouble would begin.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d have it in the bank or invested and it
would bring you in, say, twenty thousand dollars a year;
well, you couldn’t spend that on the dock-side, could you?
You wouldn’t be able to spend it at all unless you gave
up the <i>Sarah</i> and lived ashore in a fine house with a
carriage and horses and servants, and to do that you’d
have to become a lady—or gentleman,” hastily put in
Ratcliffe, the figure on the keg suddenly threatening to
turn on him. “You’d have to do that, and you’d have
to do more than that: you’d have to learn all sorts of
things.”</p>

<p>“Which sort?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots. Can you write, Jude?”</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>“Told me the other day you couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve most forgot. Pap started to learn me, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
he said he reckoned I was more cut out for makin’
puddin’s, but he learned me to write my name.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ever grow rich, you’ll have to do a lot
more than write your name.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to write checks and letters, and, what’s
more, you’ll have to be able to read them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon,” said the philosophical Jude, “it’ll be
time enough to bother about that when I’m rich—and
seems to me I’ll never be rich with them two diddling
Satan same as they’ve done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will; you are going to be rich some day,
as rich as I am. I’m a fortune teller. Show us your
hand.”</p>

<p>Jude held out a hand, and Ratcliffe examined the palm
where the lines were few but straight and clear cut. It
was a beautiful little hand, despite the hard work it had
done, full of character and vigor, and expressing kindliness
and honesty and capability.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe had an instinct for hands. A hand could attract
or repulse him just as powerfully as a face; more
so, perhaps, for a hand never lies.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said he, “you are going to be rich, you can’t
escape it, and you are going to learn reading and writing
and arithmetic, and you are going to live to be a hundred.”</p>

<p>“Cut me throat first!” said Jude. “Heave ahead.”</p>

<p>“And you are going to England some day, and you’ll
turn into a Britisher.”</p>

<p>“Damned if I do! Satan!”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” came a faint voice from below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
“Rat says I’m goin’ to turn into a Britisher.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t own you. Quit foolin’ and get the
dinner ready.”</p>

<p>Jude uncurled herself, came down from the keg with
a thud, ran to the open skylight, and was about to reply
in kind, when her eye caught sight of something that
brought her to a halt.</p>

<p>They were handling the canvas on the <i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>“Cark’s off!” cried she.</p>

<p>Satan came on deck. Across the blue blaze of the sea
they could hear now the clank of the windlass pawls,—the
<i>Juan’s</i> anchor was coming up.</p>

<p>“I thought Sellers would have come on board before
they started,” said Ratcliffe. “They’re in a big hurry,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Satan with a grin. “He’ll crack on
everything to get to Havana for that dynamite; won’t
stop to eat their dinners till they’re back,—that’s what
they’d have us believe—swabs!”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you think they are going to Havana?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re <em>goin’</em> to Havana right enough,” said Satan.
“You watch and you’ll see them headin’ that way. Look!
she’s fillin’ to the wind.”</p>

<p>The anchor was home now, and they watched the sails
filling as she headed on the same course the <i>Dryad</i> had
taken. She dipped her flag, and they returned the compliment;
then she drew past the southern reefs, the hull
vanished, and nothing remained but the topsails far
against the western blue.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, down below at dinner, Jude, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
had said no word about the departure of the <i>Juan</i>, but
seemed to have been thinking a lot, suddenly spoke.</p>

<p>“You never told me that chap was going to Havana for
dynamite,” said Jude. “What for—to bust the wreck
open?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” replied Satan. “Did you think he wanted
it to eat?”</p>

<p>“There’s no knowing what a feller may swallow, seeing
you’ve swallowed that yarn,” said Jude. “He’s gone to
Havana to sell us, that’s my ’pinion.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Lord! there’s many a way of sellin’ fools.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe felt that the truth was with Jude, he felt an
uneasy conviction that they had been done. The hurried
departure of Carquinez seemed to put a seal on the business.
He looked at Satan expecting an explosion; but
Satan was quite calm and helping himself to canned ox
tongue.</p>

<p>“Seein’ I have the chart,” said he, “where’s the sellin’
to come in?”</p>

<p>“But you’ve give him the location,” said Jude. “You
said yourself that the place was fixed on every chart and
a chap had only to have Lone Reef in his head to put his
claws on the wreck.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Satan; “but the location is no use
without the chart.”</p>

<p>“What are you gettin’ at?”</p>

<p>“I’m tryin’ to get at your intellects. How often have
you seen that chart?”</p>

<p>“Dozens of times.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
“Ever noticed anything queer about it? Not you!
Giving sass to your betters is your lay in life instead
of usin’ your eyes.” He pushed his plate away, produced
the tobacco box, and, taking the chart from it, laid
it on the table.</p>

<p>Jude got up and came behind him to look, while Ratcliffe
leaned forward.</p>

<p>“There’s the chart,” said Satan. “There’s the reef,
and there’s the name of the hooker pointin’ at the reef,
and there’s the latitude and longitude wrote up in the
corner. Plain, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s plain enough,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Jude, munching a biscuit, concurred.</p>

<p>“Plain enough, ain’t it?” went on Satan. “Give a man
the name of Lone Reef, and with any old Admiralty
chart he’ll get there, and he has only to land on the reef
to find the hooker stuck there in that crik between them
two arms. Jude has seen her, and I’ve walked over her
and ’xamined her, and she’d have been broke open maybe
by this, only chaps don’t land on reefs like that, not
unless a storm lands them. We struck it huntin’ for
abalones. Plain enough, ain’t it? Well, I tell you the
whole business is no use to any man who hasn’t that
chart in his hand and who can’t read what’s written on
it secret. Here you are! Take a good long look, and
I’ll give you ten dollars if you spot what I mean. It’s
as clear as simple.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe spread the thing before him on the table.</p>

<p>“I can’t see anything in it,” said he at last, “except
what’s written plain enough. There’s Rum Cay, there’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the reef, the name of the wreck with a pointer to the
reef, and the latitude and longitude up in the corner.
No, I can’t see anything but that: it all seems plain as
a pikestaff. I take an interest in cryptograms, too.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Cryptograms? Hidden writing.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what’s before you,” said Satan. “Pap
never twigged it, nor any of the crowd that had the
handlin’ of it. It’s only a month ago I spotted it.”</p>

<p>“You never said a word to me,” cut in Jude.</p>

<p>“Get back to your place and don’t be chewin’ in my
ear,” said Satan, reaching for the chart and pocketing
it again. “Tell you? Likely! Why, if I had, you’d
have let it out, same as you did the lie of the reef to
Rat here the other day. Get on with your dinner!
Why haven’t we any potatoes?”</p>

<p>“No time to boil them,” said Jude, “cleanin’ up your
mushy abalones.”</p>

<p>“No time, and you yarnin’ and havin’ your future
told! I heard you.”</p>

<p>“My fault,” said Ratcliffe. “I began the business.”</p>

<p>“Not you,” said Satan. “I heard her start in on it,
sayin’ what she’d do with a fortune if she had it and
finishin’ up by mistrustin’ me.”</p>

<p>“Lord love you for a liar! I only said them two
guys had done you in over the wreck,” cried Jude.
“Don’t be stickin’ words in my mouth.”</p>

<p>“How was it you came to spot the cryptogram?”
asked Ratcliffe, eager to cut the dissension short.</p>

<p>“The which?” asked Satan. “Oh, ay—well, it come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
natural for me to say to myself, ‘Here’s a thing that’s
been hid up and kept secret, yet it’s all wrote out as
plain as my palm.’ I said to myself, ‘It’s too blame
simple! A man who knows where money is hid doesn’t
write the location on a bit of paper, to be lost, maybe,
and picked up by God knows who. Why, drop that chart
in the streets of Havana, and the first chap with any
knowledge in his head that picks it up will turn it into
dollars right off. It’s a sure bait for fools, anyhow,
and a wreckin’ expedition would be out before the end
of the week. They’d only have to look up any chart
that’s been printed the last hundred years to find Lone
Reef as easy as the Swimmer Rocks.’ Then I said to
myself, ‘What in the nation did the guy want makin’
a chart at all for? Why couldn’t he have written on
a piece of paper, “The Nombre de Dios lies on Lone
Reef, sou’west of Rum Cay”? That’s all the chart says,
and yet he must go and make drawin’s; must have
taken him an hour’s pen scraping to make that chart.’
Puttin’ the two things together, I says to myself, ‘The
feller concerned must have been a fool in two ways if
this thing’s genuine,—a fool to leave the fac’s as plain
as an ad for liver pills, and a fool to waste his time
drawin’ his advertisement instead of writin’ it,’ but I
reckoned he was no fool. Dad was always quotin’ some
damn ass who said the world was most made up of fools.
Well, in my ’xperience that don’t hold. Maybe in Europe
it does, but not in Havana and the Gulf ports, anyway.
So I says to myself, ‘Let’s try and see what the
guy was drivin’ at.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
“And you won’t tell us how you did it?”</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon not.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Satan, “I may be wrong; though I’m
pretty sure I’m right—and I b’lieve in a shut head.”</p>

<p>“You opened your head to Cark, anyhow,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you once and I won’t tell you twice, if I have
any more chat out of you, I’ll lay into you with a slipper!
O’ course I opened my head to him! Did you want him
hanging round here and sniffin’ out the cache? Haven’t
we got rid of him? I don’t want any more talkin’. I’ve
my plan laid out and you’ve get to take my orders right
from now without questions!” He turned to Ratcliffe.
“You don’t mind helpin’ to work the boat, leavin’ sailing
directions to me?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Ratcliffe. “I’m quite content to help
and look on, leaving things to you. What’s your first
move?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to clear out of this tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you was going to wait for Cark to
come back,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Never you mind what you thought. I’m goin’ to
clear out of this tomorrow. Meantime, I want more
stuff from the cache, and you’d better take the dinghy
and get it right off. I want provisions for a month for
the three of us.”</p>

<span class="subhead">CUSS WORDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> they had washed up and put the plates in
their rack, Jude commandeered Ratcliffe to help
with the dinghy. Satan, having given his orders, had
retired into himself and the business of patching an old
sail. He was seated at the work under the awning, and
he seemed scarcely to notice the others as they got the
boat away.</p>

<p>“Satan’s got something up his sleeve,” said Jude as
they pulled for the beach. “I reckon he’s laying low to
get the better of Cark.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me,” said Ratcliffe, “I think he has
got the better of him in some way or another. I don’t
know how, and I don’t want to. I’d sooner wait and
see. It’s as interesting as a game of chess.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Chess—oh, it’s a game. I’ll show you some day.
Don’t you ever play games, Jude?”</p>

<p>“You bet! Why, I won five dollars day before we put
out buckin’ against the red at Chinese Charlie’s—y’know
Havana? Well, it’s on the Calle sin Pedro. They play
faro, but mostly r’lette.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
“Oh, I didn’t mean that sort of games.”</p>

<p>“Which sort did you mean?” asked Jude, as the nose
of the boat beached on the sand and they scrambled out.
“Did you mean whisky drinkin’ and cuttin’ and carryin’
on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, no! I meant games, just ordinary games.”</p>

<p>Jude, the boat well beached, sat down on the blazing
sands. It was two hours past noon, and the heat of the
day had lifted under the freshening wind from the east,
the tide was on the turn, and the far-off lamentations
of the gulls around the southern reef-spurs came mixed
with the fall of the waves,—waves scarcely a foot high,
crystal clear, less waves than giant ripples.</p>

<p>Beyond the <i>Sarah Tyler</i> and her reflection on the water
lay the violet-colored sea, infinity, and the blue of sky,
broken only by a gull, spar white in the dazzle.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe sat down beside his companion. Jude, like
any old salt, had her moments of dead laziness. Active
as a kitten as a rule, she would suddenly knock off,
when the fancy took her, “let go all holts,” to use
Satan’s expression, and laze. You couldn’t kick her out
of it, Satan said.</p>

<p>She had brought an old pair of boots for going through
the bay cedar bushes. It wasn’t good to walk among
the bushes unshod: there were tarantulas there, and scorpions,
to say nothing of stump cacti. The boots were
lying beside her on the sand, to be put on only at the
last moment.</p>

<p>“What you mean by ordinary games?” asked Jude
suddenly, finishing the inspection of a new variety of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
soft-shell crab she had just caught and flinging it into
the sea.</p>

<p>“Oh, the games people play,” said Ratcliffe, who had
almost forgotten what they had been talking about. He
tried to explain, and found it singularly hard, especially
when cross-examined.</p>

<p>Jude did not seem able to understand grown men and
women spending half a day “knockin’ a ball about.”</p>

<p>“I used to play ma’bles with Dutch Mike’s kids when
we were at Pensacola,” said she. “Mike ran a whisky
joint, and the kids were pretty ornery. When we’d
done playin’ marbles they’d have a cussin’ bee.”</p>

<p>“What on earth’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve heard of a spellin’ bee—you get a prize
for spellin’ the best. Well, a cussin’ bee you start cussin’
each other, and the one that cusses hardest gets the prize.
Pap never knew till one day he let into me with a strap
for somethin’ or ’nother and I let fly at him. Then he
found it was Mike’s children who’d been learnin’ me, and
he had a dust-up with Mike on the wharf, and left him
limpin’ for the rest of his natural. Did you cuss when
you was young?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ratcliffe. “I learned that later.”</p>

<p>“’R you any good at it?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Have a try,” said Jude, losing her languor. “Clench
your fists to it and have a go at me, and then I’ll have
a go at you—there’s no one listenin’. Pretend you’re
the skipper and I’m a hand that’s been haulin’ on the
wrong rope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
“No,” said Ratcliffe. “I’m no use at it, and it’s not a
nice game, anyway. I’d sooner play at something else.”</p>

<p>Jude sniffed. She evidently felt snubbed. “I’m not a
baby to be playing games,” said she. “You can go and
play by yourself if you want to.”</p>

<p>She collapsed on her back with her knees up and her
old hat covering her face; then from under the hat:</p>

<p>“You’ll hear all the swearin’ you want to in a minute
from the old hooker.”</p>

<p>“You mean Satan?”</p>

<p>“Yep, the minute he turns his eye ashore and sees us
lazin’ here instead of workin’.”</p>

<p>“Then, come on.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said Jude, “not till Satan begins. I’m too
comfortable. I been working hard all the morning while
you two was aboard the <i>Juan</i> clackin’ with Sellers and
havin’ drinks, I bet. I’m going to rest myself—what did
you have?”</p>

<p>“Ginger beer and a cigar.”</p>

<p>“Did you take notice of Cark’s face?”</p>

<p>“Rather!”</p>

<p>“They say he hasn’t any one side to his face where
the patch is. I’d like to see him with the patch off,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! I saw quite enough of him with it on.
Come, get up, and let’s get to work.”</p>

<p>“I’m not goin’ to work no more,” mumbled Jude
drowsily. “I’m dead sick of fetchin’ and carryin’. Let
Satan go and fetch and carry for himself. I’m going
to stick here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
“On the island?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“And give up Satan and the <i>Sarah</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do for a living?”</p>

<p>“Start a la’ndry.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no one here to give you any washing to
do.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have all the easier time.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. It’s a bright idea, and I’ll stay with you
and carry the laundry basket.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t! I’ll stick here alone.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, across the water from the <i>Sarah</i> and shattering
this fantasy, came a voice. It was Satan’s voice,
distant and borne on the breeze. Ratcliffe thought he
could make out the words “lazy dog.”</p>

<p>He got up. Jude with the old panama over her face
had stiffened out as if dead. He tried to turn her over
with his foot. Then he felt half frightened. Had the
sun got to her head, and was all that nonsense talk
delirium?</p>

<p>He knelt down beside her and shook her.</p>

<p>“Jude, what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>He took the panama from the face. The eyes were
closed and the features were in repose.</p>

<p>Now, really alarmed, he jumped up, ran down to the
boat, seized the baling tin, and filled it with sea water.
He had never seen a case of sunstroke, but he had heard
cold water on the head was a remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
As he turned back with the tin the corpse was sitting
up putting on its boots.</p>

<p>“What’re you doing with that baling tin?” said Jude.</p>

<p>“I’ll jolly soon show you!” said he, making toward
her. “Shamming dead!”</p>

<p>But before he could reach her she was gone among
the bushes, one boot on, the other off. Then, flinging
the baling tin away, he joined her, helped her on with
the boot, and they started. Jude, as if to make up, put
her hand into his in a trusting and loving manner. She
swung his hand as they walked. Then, near their destination,
she flung it away and made off, hunting like a
dog among the bushes till she found what she was in
search of,—a long, knotted rope.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked he.</p>

<p>“You wait and see,” replied Jude. “Here’s the cache.
Mind where you’re walkin’ or you’ll be into it.”</p>

<p>The cache was well hidden among the bay cedars.
The opening, eight feet long by six broad, was covered
over with short poles spread with cut branches gone
withered with the sun. When they had got the covering
off, Jude tied one end of the rope to a tree close by
and dropped the other end into the cache. She swung
herself down by it, and Ratcliffe followed.</p>

<p>From the floor of this place a step, two feet high, gave
entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Jude. “It may rain till it’s black, but
it never floods the cave. The water drains off before
it can rise the height of the step.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
There were a candle and some matches inside the cave
entrance. She lit the candle and led the way.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe was astounded, less by the size of the place,
than the stacks of goods,—canned peaches, condensed
milk, corned beef, tomatoes, ox tongues, Heinz’s pickles,
Nabisco wafers. The old brig, making for some gulf
port, must have been a floating Italian warehouse as far
as cargo was concerned.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at Satan not wanting Sellers and
Carquinez to spot all this,” said he. “Why, there must
be five hundred pounds’ worth of stuff here. Aren’t
you afraid that nigger who skipped from you at Pine
Island may split?”</p>

<p>“Sakes, no! He was too much afeared of Satan.
Satan was always threatening to skin him. Besides, he
doesn’t know. We told him this place was Turtle Island,
and that’s a hundred and fifty miles to s’uth’ard. You
trust Satan to keep a thing dark. Here, catch hold of
the candle while I collect.”</p>

<p>There were two sacks folded up on the floor. She
started collecting things, and when the sacks were half-filled
Jude, clambering out of the pit, hauled them up
by the rope.</p>

<p>“Anything more?” asked he, from below.</p>

<p>“I reckon that will be enough,” said Jude, looking down
at him. “It’ll take us all our time to carry them to the
boat, and if Satan ain’t satisfied he can come and fetch
some more himself.”</p>

<p>“Then drop the rope; I want to get out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Jude, kneeling at the cache edge, lowered the rope
gingerly. He reached up, and was just about to seize
the loose end when it eluded him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you catch hold?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“I can’t. How could I when you pulled it up again.
Go on, drop it and don’t play the fool.”</p>

<p>“Who’s playin’ the fool?”</p>

<p>“You are.”</p>

<p>The rope, instead of descending again, was hauled
right out of the cache. Then a face appeared, looking
down and framed against the sky. He had forgotten
the snub he had given her on the beach, but she hadn’t.</p>

<p>“D’y’r’member what you said down there on the
beach?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“No, what about?”</p>

<p>“Cussin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Said I wanted you to play games that wasn’t nice.”</p>

<p>“I never said any such thing.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t yer? Well, whether you did or you didn’t,
you’ve got to swear before I let you out.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I’ll stay in. Go on, Jude, don’t be silly.
It’s cold down here.”</p>

<p>The rope came down, and he was just seizing the end
when it was whipped out of his hand.</p>

<p>“Damn!” said Ratcliffe wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>“Now you’re talkin’,” said Jude.</p>

<p>Like a boy fishing for polliwogs, she lowered the rope
again and snatched it up suddenly, bringing with it another
oath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
But the third time he was too quick for her. Then
as he came swarming up with skinned knuckles and rage
in his heart, she bolted. He chased her, dodging here
and there among the bushes, then he chased her round
a tree, caught her, and, in his anger and irritation somehow,
kissed her.</p>

<p>The perfectly amazing smack on the face that followed
was revelation; it also knocked him off his balance
so that he sat down as though cut off at the knees.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE COMING OF CLEARY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">She</span> stood for a moment, frightened at her handiwork.</p>

<p>Then, as he pulled himself together, she drew away
a step.</p>

<p>“What ails you?” asked she.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, sitting up with his hand to the top of his
head, groaned.</p>

<p>She drew a step closer. Then she saw that he was
laughing, and drew a step back.</p>

<p>“Get up, and don’t be fooling,” said she.</p>

<p>“Fooling! And who started it?” asked he.</p>

<p>Jude made no reply. She turned and went off to the
cache, lugged the sacks a bit more away from the opening,
and started to put the poles across. When he joined
her on the work she wouldn’t speak. She was evidently
mortally offended.</p>

<p>He knew at once and by some fine instinct what was
the matter with her. He had trod on her dignity, like
the Thelusson woman,—treated her like a child, that is
to say like a girl, for the two things were synonymous
with Jude, who seemed to have no more idea of the
realities of sex than a pumpkin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
When she did speak at last, it was to give jeering
orders.</p>

<p>“Lord! Did you never have to use your hands?
Which way is that to be sticking the poles? Why, it’d
take twenty dozen to cover it the way you’re doing!
Leave a foot and a half between them.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Ratcliffe humbly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say two foot.”</p>

<p>“Sorry.”</p>

<p>“Now the branches an’ stuff.”</p>

<p>She had reserved one of the poles, for what reason
soon became apparent.</p>

<p>Each sack was too heavy to be carried by one person,
so she slung one to the middle of the pole, and they
started for the beach, Caleb and Joshua fashion, Ratcliffe
in front.</p>

<p>It was horrible work. They had to keep step, which
was difficult; owing to the bushes, the going was bad.
The sack kept slipping toward Jude, owing to the inequality
of their heights, and the pressure of the pole on
his shoulder was galling; also the wind had changed and
was coming from the direction of the gulf, warm and
moist like the breath from a great mouth.</p>

<p>When they reached the beach he sat down. Unused
to hard work and unused to the climate, he was sweating
and exhausted. Jude looked comparatively cool and
fresh.</p>

<p>“Now then, Lazybones!” said Jude. Then she collapsed
also, sitting down with her knees up and her arms
round them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
She seemed to have forgotten the sack, Ratcliffe, everything,
as she sat whistling dreamily between her teeth
and staring across the water toward the <i>Sarah</i>.</p>

<p>She had kicked off her boots, and her toes were playing
with the sand. Uncramped by boots, her feet were
as expressive as her hands.</p>

<p>“You’ll hear Satan begin to holler in a minute,” said
Jude.</p>

<p>“Let him,” said the other, “I’m not going to stir another
foot till I’ve rested myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t holler at you. It’s me he’ll go for;
you’re the first-class passenger.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not: I’m one of the crew.”</p>

<p>Jude laughed in a mirthless manner.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon myself one, anyhow,” said he. “I
wouldn’t have come on board unless I was to help in
working the boat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Satan won’t mind you helpin’ to work her,”
replied she; “but he didn’t bring you aboard for that.”</p>

<p>“I know—and it was awfully decent of him. He just
thought I’d like the cruise.”</p>

<p>Jude sniffed.</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t know Satan,” said she.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Satan never does nothing for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did he bring me aboard for?”</p>

<p>“Lord knows,” said Jude; “but he’s got something up
his sleeve, sure. Mind you, Satan’s as straight as they
make them unless he’s dealin’ with law chaps and such,
and you’d be safe with him if you was blind and dumb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and covered with diamonds only waitin’ to be picked off
you. You see, you’re straight, and anyone that’s straight
with Satan he’s straight with them. It’s different with
lawyers, or guys like Cark and Sellers, who’d beat their
own gran’mothers out of their store teeth. All the same,
you look out with Satan. He’s got some plan about you,
sure.”</p>

<p>“What sort of plan is it, do you think, Jude?”</p>

<p>“Lord knows. Nothing to harm you, anyway; maybe
it’s to go shares in some deal—I dunno.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m up for any deal he likes to propose that
would benefit him—as much money as he wants.”</p>

<p>“Satan’s not set on money,” said Jude, “not in a big
way. I reckon he’s something like Pap. Pap would
take no end of trouble making a few dollars, but he was
never really set on bein’ rich. I reckon he took up that
old wreck business more for the fun of the thing than
the dollars. He used to say great riches was only trouble
to a man, an’ that he only wanted God’s good air and
’nough to live on.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he was right,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“I reckon Satan cottoned to you because he thought
you was honest,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope I am.”</p>

<p>“He said to me, right off, after you’d gone back to
the yacht, ‘I reckon that feller’s honest,’ he said.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe laughed.</p>

<p>“You see,” went on Jude, “you don’t pick up honest
parties round these parts, not by the bushel. You might
rake Havana with a finetooth comb lookin’ for fellers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
that wouldn’t do you, but you wouldn’t find none. It’s
the same all round the gulf, from N’Orleans to Campêche;
you can’t stick your nose in anywhere without
being stung—if you’re a softy.”</p>

<p>“So he liked me because he thought I was straight.
What did you like me for, Jude?”</p>

<p>“Lord! if you don’t fancy yourself! Who told you
I liked you?”</p>

<p>“You did last night. You said you and Satan took
to me right off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I? Well, maybe it was them pajamas—Hullo!”
The shrill notes of a bo’sn’s whistle came over
the water. She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>Satan’s form appeared at the rail of the <i>Sarah</i>. He
was making movements with his arms as though signaling,
and Jude flung up an arm in answer.</p>

<p>Then, shading her eyes, she looked seaward.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Come on!” said Jude.</p>

<p>She seized the sack, called on him to help her, and
between them they ran it down to the water’s edge.
Then they got the dinghy afloat, the sack on board, and
started.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” again asked Ratcliffe, as they rowed.</p>

<p>“Sail,” said Jude.</p>

<p>He had seen nothing, perhaps because of the sun-dazzle
on the water or because he had not looked in the
right direction. The sensitiveness of the Tylers to the
approach of strangers and their hawklike vision struck
him as belonging almost to the uncanny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Satan had rigged a tackle, and without a word uttered
the sack was got aboard and below. Then and not till
then did Satan speak.</p>

<p>“It’s Cleary,” said he.</p>

<p>Jude took the old glass he had been using, and examined
the stranger, then she handed it to Ratcliffe. He
turned it on the fleck of sail which sprang gigantic into
the form of a big fore-and-aft-rigged boat, beating up
for the island, the late afternoon sunlight flashing back
from the foam at the forefoot and her foam-wet bows.</p>

<p>“Who is Cleary?” asked he, handing back the glass.</p>

<p>“Cark’s partner,” said Satan, “sort of half and half
partner. They’re always bestin’ one another. Cleary is
by way of bein’ a ship breaker and dealer in odds and
ends; owns a couple of ratty old schooners besides that
old ketch. Wonder what he’s doin’ down here? Curse
him!”</p>

<p>“He’s after Cark, most likely,” said Jude. “Maybe
he’s got a smell of the wreck.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” replied Satan. “He’s always spyin’ on Cark.
There’s nothin’ much that Cleary don’t know, and if he
got wind that Cark’s on a likely job he’d put out after
him.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Ratcliffe all at once that the old wreck
lying on that unseen reef might have been likened to a
carcass in the desert, and that he was watching the
gathering of the vultures to a feast.</p>

<p>First Carquinez, now Cleary—how many more would
come circling out of the blue?</p>

<p>He said so, and Satan concurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
“It’s got out somehow or ’nother,” said Satan, “and
Lord only knows there may be half a dozen others on
the hunt. You see, the very fac’ of Cark’s puttin’ to
sea himself would give suspicions to half Havana; but
Cleary is the only man beside Cark that knows my ports
of call. He knows I come here for abalones, and he
knows I hunt round Pine Island, not to say other places.”</p>

<p>Satan fell into meditation for a moment. Then he
resumed:</p>

<p>“That’s what the cuss has been doin’. He’s been on
the hunt for me, same as Cark was, only for different
reasons. Now you wait and see. Jude!”</p>

<p>“Hullo,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Did you cover the cache proper?”</p>

<p>“You bet; but there’s a sack of stuff we didn’t manage
to bring off. It’s among the bushes.”</p>

<p>“It’ll have to lay there.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of Cleary’s boat?” asked Ratcliffe
as he watched the approaching ketch.</p>

<p>“The <i>Natchez</i>,” said Satan, “an old cod boat, built
at Marthas Vineyard. Lord! ain’t they crackin’ on!
Cleary’s in a hurry. There’s no denyin’ that.”</p>

<p>He whistled contentedly as he leaned on the rail, and
Ratcliffe, watching his hatchet-sharp profile, wondered
what was coming next. Of one thing he was beginning
to feel certain,—Cleary, Carquinez, Sellers, and anything
else that might come out of Havana on the long trail
for plunder would find a match in Satan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="subhead">AN HONEST MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> ketch carried on, heading straight for the <i>Sarah</i>;
then, spilling the wind from her sails, she came
round, presenting a full view of her dirty old hull and
dropping her anchor two cable lengths away.</p>

<p>Almost on the last rasp of the anchor chain she
dropped a boat, which shoved off for the <i>Sarah</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s Cleary,” said Satan, shading his eyes.</p>

<p>It was, and as Cleary came on board, leg over rail,
saluting Satan with the affability of old acquaintanceship
and the quarterdeck with a squirt of tobacco juice, Ratcliffe
fell to wondering what sort of place Havana might
be and what else it might give up in the way of detrimentals.</p>

<p>Carquinez was bad and Sellers was bad, but Cleary
was—Cleary. Against the gold and blue of afternoon,
the sight of this faded man, who looked as though he
had seen better days, who suggested a broken-down
schoolmaster, with a slungshot in his pocket, struck Ratcliffe
with astonishment and depression. It was as
though the dazzling air had suddenly split to disclose
a London slum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
“Hullo! Hullo!” said Cleary. “Thought I recognized
the old hooker. What you doin’ down here away?”</p>

<p>Jude made a dive for the galley, and Ratcliffe could
hear her choking. The sound banished the feeling of
depression and repulsion created by the newcomer and
brightened him somehow.</p>

<p>Here was the comic man of the pantomime come
aboard.</p>

<p>“What am I doin’?” said Satan. “I’m fishin’ for
chair-backs. What are you doin’ yourself?”</p>

<p>Cleary turned, spat his quid overboard, and then, leaning
on the rail, looking seaward, with his back to the
others, and, just as easy as though he were aboard his
own ship, laughed.</p>

<p>“Fishin’ for chair-backs!” Then, sluing his head half
round, “How’s the abalone fishin’ gone?”</p>

<p>“Jude!” cried Satan.</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Bring up them pearls!”</p>

<p>Cleary turned, and, leaning with his back against the
rail, began to fill an old pipe in a languid and leisurely
manner. Then, when the pearls were produced, he
turned them from the matchbox into the palm of his
hand.</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Cleary.</p>

<p>“Forty dollars,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Forty which?”</p>

<p>“Dollars.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t worth forty cents.”</p>

<p>“Well, who’s askin’ you to deal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Cleary carefully poured the pearls into the matchbox,
closed it, and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Satan did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>“Jude!” said Satan.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Bring up them cigars!”</p>

<p>“Who’s the gentleman?” asked Cleary.</p>

<p>“Gentleman came aboard for a cruise off a yacht.
You needn’t mind him; he’s only out for pleasure.”</p>

<p>Cleary nodded to Ratcliffe, who nodded in return.
Then things hung for a moment till Jude appeared with
the cigar-box, and the newcomer, having tapped the tobacco
out of his pipe, chose a cigar, lit it and, leaning
with his back against the rail and his thumbs in the
armholes of his old waistcoat, blew clouds. He seemed
for a moment far away in thought, and Ratcliffe, watching
him and Satan,—Jude having vanished again, attacked
with another fit of choking,—puzzled his head in
vain to find out the inner meaning of what was going
on. The wretched pearls were scarcely worth five dollars,
he had heard Satan say so, and Cleary, evidently
an expert, was not the man to pay eight times their
worth, nor was Satan the man to allow the other to
pocket them.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Cleary spoke.</p>

<p>“Cark’s a clever man, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Well, seein’ he’s your partner, you’re a better judge
than me,” replied Satan.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe that’s so,” said Cleary. “Partners we
were, and partners we are till I ketch him and bust him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
“Why, what’s he been doin’ to you?”</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll tell you,” said Cleary. “I’m an honest
man. I don’t say in trade I’m not above shavin’ the barber,
but between man an’ man I’m honest, and I’m goin’
to tell you straight out Cark and me has been layin’ for
you ever since your dad was fool enough to give Cark
the tip about that treasure business. I wasn’t keen on
it, same as he was. I allowed there might be somethin’
in it—but that don’t matter. What gets my monkey
is Cark he gets fearful thick with Sellers, then he cools
off on the business of the treasure gettin’, and a matter
of two weeks ago he rigs up a job for me to see after
at Pensacola that’d have taken me two months and more.
I says to myself, ‘There’s somethin’ in this.’ Says nothin’
to Cark. Off I goes, taking the old <i>Natchez</i>. Hadn’t
reached the latitood of Key West when back I puts,
and finds Cark gone with the <i>Juan</i> and Sellers.</p>

<p>“Then I knew he’s started to hunt for you again,
leavin’ me in the lonely cold. He’s been huntin’ you
ever since last fall, that’s straight; but he’d never let
me down before. He’d always told me the results. I
tell you he’s huntin’ for you now, and the surprisin’
thing is he hasn’t found you, knowing as he does this
is one of your grounds.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he hasn’t found me?”</p>

<p>“What you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, he was here this morning and off not four
hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Christopher!”</p>

<p>“Him and Sellers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
“Holy Mike!”</p>

<p>“You was comin’ up from West, you ought to have
sighted him.”</p>

<p>“Sighted nothin’ but a tank, and her nearly hull
down.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’d been here a few hours earlier, you’d
have smelt the old <i>Juan</i> as well as sightin’ her.”</p>

<p>“Was he here on business?”</p>

<p>“He was,—he was after that wreck Pap told him of.
You just told me he’s been after me since last fall spyin’
on me. I know it, and I’m pretty sick of the business.
B’sides, he’s as good to help in it as anyone else; so
I’ve made a contrac’ with him.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sufferin</em>’ Moses!—a contrac’ with Cark!” Cleary
stood for a moment as though absorbing this news, then
he laughed, the funniest laugh Ratcliffe had ever heard,—it
was like the whinny of a pony. He saw Jude’s head
at the cabin hatch, and the head suddenly duck and vanish,
as though her body had been doubled up.</p>

<p>“A contrac’ with Cark!”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you laughin’ at?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’. May I ask what terms?”</p>

<p>“We go shares.”</p>

<p>“In the pickin’s?”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“Have you give him the location?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“You’ve give him the location and let him slip his
cable—him and Sellers?”</p>

<p>“What odds? It’ll take a month to bust her open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
and hunt for the stuff. I’ll be after him tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Cleary crossed his arms and stood with the half-cigar
stuck in the corner of his mouth and pointing skyward,
his eyes fixed on the deck and his left eye half closed.</p>

<p>Jude’s face had reappeared at the cabin hatch, and the
grin on it spread to Ratcliffe’s.</p>

<p>Satan alone was unmoved, half-sitting on the keg and
cutting up some tobacco.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cleary at last, “you’ve made your bargain,
there’s no gettin’ round that. <em>I’m</em> not wishin’ to
poke my nose in your business, nor to ask what your
share is to be, but I’m partners with Cark, and you see
how he’s let me down—cayn’t you give me a lead?”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Give me a lead to the location. It won’t make a cent
difference to you.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Clear enough, I don’t want none of your share.
Cark’s the man I want to tap, having a right to, being
partners.”</p>

<p>Satan seemed to turn this matter over in his mind for
a moment. Then he said, “Suppose we come back to
them pearls?”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Cleary in a lively voice. “What’s this
you was askin’, forty? Well, forty you shall have.”</p>

<p>He produced an old brown pocketbook, counted out
four ten-dollar notes, and handed them over.</p>

<p>Satan examined each note, back and front, folded
them, and placed them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Cleary, “out with the lead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
“You’ll have it tomorrow,” said Satan. “I’m pickin’
up my anchor tomorrow mornin’. You’ve only to follow
me.”</p>

<p>“I’d rayther have the indications on paper.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you would, but you won’t. I’ve made my
bargain with Cark, and there’s nothin’ in the contrac’
about givin’ the location away to third parties. I can’t
help you followin’ me.”</p>

<p>“I take you,” said Cleary.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROBLEMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> sun was nearly touching the horizon when he
dropped into his boat and rowed off.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Ratcliffe. “Are you in earnest
with that chap?”</p>

<p>“I sure am,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Going to take him down to Lone Reef?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“But how about Carquinez? We had got to wait for
him here till he gets back from Havana with the dynamite.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Satan, “we’d got to wait here one week,
or maybe ten days allowin’ for weather—where was you
born?”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Cark’s tried to sell me a pup, that’s how! He’s gone
to no Havana: he’s crackin’ on for the wreck with every
stitch he can carry. Reckons to bust her open and scoop
the boodle while we’re layin’ here rubbin’ our noses and
waitin’ for him. Mind you,” said Satan, “I may be
wrong, but that’s my ’pinion.”</p>

<p>“But he sailed off toward Havana.”</p>

<p>“Lord! Hasn’t he a rudder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
“All the same, would it pay him?”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he played a dirty trick on you like that,
wouldn’t he be afraid you’d split?”</p>

<p>“Who to?”</p>

<p>“To the authorities at Cuba.”</p>

<p>“D’you remember Sellers talkin’ about landin’ the
stuff,” asked Satan, “sayin’ they’d have to take it round
to Santiago way? They thought I was drinkin’ all that
in. If there were any dollars in the business, d’you think
they’d touch Cuba? Not they! They’d either cache the
stuff or run it to some likely port. I was laughin’ in my
hat all the time. Now you may think me a suspicious
cuss. I’m not; but a feller has to run by compass in this
world or go off his course, and my compass in this turnout
is Cark. I say he’s gone down to Lone Reef and
given me the left leg over the business, and my compass
is the fac’ that he can’t run straight. Not if he tried to,
he couldn’t run straight; nor could Sellers nor Cleary.
If them fellers were straight, I’d match them and give
them a fair deal. As it is, they’re like a lot of blind
bally-hoolies playin’ blindman’s buff, runnin’ round and
round, with me in the middle, tryin’ to kidoodle me and
bein’ kidoodled themselves. Forty dollars for them
rotten pearls, and all sorts of fixin’s out of Sellers—<em>and
I haven’t done with them yet</em>!”</p>

<p>It had seemed to Ratcliffe, on board the <i>Juan</i>, that
Carquinez was the spider of the web of this business.
It seemed to him now that the spider was Satan.</p>

<p>He began to wonder was there any wreck at all, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the treasure story a myth. The idea of these rogues being
incited to dreams of fortune so that they might be
plundered of pots of paint and cans of turpentine and
a few dollars appealed to him immensely. He remembered
Thelusson and Skelton, he remembered Jude’s yarn
about fruit steamers being held up, he remembered
Carquinez and Sellers, and he had just seen Cleary; and
of a sudden Satan’s ocean-wide activities appeared before
him in nightmare contrast with their microscopic results.
Great steamers stopped for a bunch of bananas, yachts
lying idle to careen the <i>Sarah</i>, ships sailing from Havana
to hunt for buried treasure—but in reality to supply the
wandering <i>Sarah</i> with cans of turpentine and a few dollars!
Was there any treasure, or was the whole thing
a Tyler fake invented by Pap and handed to his family
as an heirloom? He could not resist the question.</p>

<p>“That chart you showed us,” said he,—“is there anything
really in it?”</p>

<p>Satan took him at once.</p>

<p>“The chart’s all right,” said he, “for them that can
read it. If you mean is it <em>genuine</em>, I reckon it is—for
them that can read it. We’ll see some day if I’m right
or wrong; but, honest truth, I’m not botherin’ much about
it,—the chances are so big, as I told you before, against
treasure huntin’, and even if we strike it what’s the use
of barrels of gold to a feller like me? If you ask me, I’m
botherin’ more about the kid than huntin’ for money.”</p>

<p>“You mean?”</p>

<p>“Jude. Suppose I was to get a bash on the head from
one of them cusses, or drop to the smallpox, same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
as I pretended to Sellers, what’d become of the kid?”</p>

<p>The sound of the “kid” frying fish for supper came
mixed with the question.</p>

<p>“I know,” said Ratcliffe, “that’s a problem that must
often occur to you, I should think.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen the sort of crowd Havana’s made of,”
went on Satan. “It’s hard to tell which is worse, the
Yanks or the Spaniards, and there’s not a seaport that’s
not the same, and when I think of me lyin’ dead and her
driftin’ loose, it gets my goat. It’d be different if she
was a boy.”</p>

<p>“Besides that,” said the other, “she can’t go on always
as she is now.”</p>

<p>“How’d you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, dressed as she is now. She’ll grow up.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“She’ll have to dress differently some day.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ skirts?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Satan laughed a hollow laugh. The idea seemed so
futile that he did not dwell upon it, or seemed not to.</p>

<p>“Have you any female relations yourself?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Lots,” replied Ratcliffe, calling up in memory his
cousins and aunts, females of the highest upper-middle-class
respectability, and vaguely wondering what they
would think of Jude could they see her.</p>

<p>“The bother is,” said Satan, “she don’t take to women
folk; always was against them, and that Thelusson
woman put the cap on the business, kissin’ her and handin’
out slop talk. Well, I don’t know. I reckon she’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
to go on bein’ what she is till somethin’ happens; but it
would have been a lot handier if she’d been born a boy.”</p>

<p>He turned and went below.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk beyond Palm Island, and a violet
dusk, forerunner of the dark, was spreading through the
sky. Over beyond the <i>Natchez</i> the sea for a moment became
hard looking as a floor of beryl, then vague.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, lingering for a moment watching this transformation
scene, found himself thinking of Jude and her
problem. The Tylers had taken an extraordinarily firm
hold upon him. He knew them more intimately than he
knew his own relations, or fancied so. It seemed to him
that he had known them for years.</p>

<p>When this cruise was over and he packed up his traps
and left them, he would probably never see them again.
Jude and Satan would go their way and he would go his
way—and what would happen to Jude? Suppose Satan
were to die, get knocked on the head or “fall to the
smallpox”? The thought hurt him almost as much as it
hurt Satan; for Jude had, somehow or another, captured
his mind and touched his heart, and her youth and absolute
irresponsibility before the major facts of life had
infected him in the most extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>Over there on the island, engaged in the serious matter
of provisioning the <i>Sarah</i>, they had been carrying on like
children. He had not thought of it then; now, reflecting
sanely, it rose before him together with the rest of
this strange cruise, and for a moment the whole business
seemed mad, absolutely mad. The supersane figure of
Skelton rose up before him, and beyond Skelton, Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the calm, sane English country, where the Tylers would
have been impossible, the hard bourgeois conventions of
the upper-upper-middle classes, those uncles, cousins, and
aunts to whom Class was as holy as Sunday and to whom
Jude would be absolutely invisible as she was.</p>

<p>He was engaged in these reflections when a voice broke
the stillness of the evening, a half-tired, half-cantankerous
voice, the voice of an overworked housekeeper who
had been frying fish while others have been idling.</p>

<p>“<em>Ain’t</em> you comin’ to help me?” inquired the voice.</p>

<span class="subhead">HANTS AND OTHER THINGS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Down</span> below, at supper, the injured housekeeper was
still in evidence and rose to a charge that the fish
was overfried. Satan was the accuser.</p>

<p>The defendant, “het up” and flushed, replied in the
language of the sea:</p>

<p>“Go’n fry your head! Clackin’ on deck and leavin’ me
to do the work—the pair of you! It’s all men’s good
for.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you was a man!” said Satan. “You
cut and carry on like a man; scratch you and your tongue
goes both ends like a woman. Start you on a job, and
you sit down to it before it’s half done. I saw you
lazin’ on the beach, and now look where we are,—there’s
a sack of stuff not brought off and how are we to bring
it with Cleary messin’ round?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault,” said Jude. Then she checked
herself and her eyes met Ratcliffe’s.</p>

<p>“It was my fault,” said he. “I got tired.”</p>

<p>Jude looked at him. This defense of her, trifling
though it was, seemed to make a new relationship between
them. It seemed to her that Ratcliffe had suddenly
become different. She could not tell what the difference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
was or how it had come about in the least, or why she
half-resented his shielding her, even in this small matter;
then her eyes fell away and rested on the table before her.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t,” said she. “It was my fault I was foolin’
when I ought to have been workin’, and now the stuff
is lyin’ there—” She choked, and then to the horror of
Satan she pushed her plate away and broke into tears,
hiding her face on her folded arms. Then, before the
astonished ones could speak, she rose and dashed out of
the cabin.</p>

<p>“Land’s sake!” cried Satan. “What ails her? Cryin’!
She’s never done that before—and all over that rotten
sack—why, let it lay there, cuss the thing!”</p>

<p>He went on with his supper in an irritable manner.</p>

<p>“She’s overtired, maybe,” said Ratcliffe. “Wait and
I’ll fetch her back.”</p>

<p>He left the cabin and came on deck.</p>

<p>The moon had not risen yet, and the riding light, which
had been run up before supper, showed yellow against
the stars.</p>

<p>Not a sign of Jude.</p>

<p>He went forward. There she was, huddled up in the
bows.</p>

<p>“Jude!”</p>

<p>The bundle sniffed.</p>

<p>“Come on down to supper. Satan’s not angry.”</p>

<p>“Who the”—sniff—“cares whether’es angry or not?
You lea’ me alone!”</p>

<p>“But what are you crying about?”</p>

<p>“<em>Ain’t</em> cryin’!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
“Well, what are you lying on the deck for?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I choose.”</p>

<p>“Come on down and help to clear the things away.”</p>

<p>“Clear them yourself!”</p>

<p>He bent down and tried to take her arm. She shook
him off, rose suddenly like a released spring, ran to the
side where the dinghy was moored, and got over the rail.</p>

<p>He looked over. She was in the boat unfastening the
painter.</p>

<p>“Where on earth are you going?”</p>

<p>“Ashore.”</p>

<p>She pushed off.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe came down to the cabin.</p>

<p>“She’s gone ashore.”</p>

<p>“She’s gone for that sack,” said Satan unconcernedly.
“Reckons to get it off before moon rise, I expect.”</p>

<p>“But it’s too heavy for one.”</p>

<p>“She’ll do it. You’ve put her monkey up makin’ her
confess it was her fault. She’s never done that before
in all her born life. She’s just natural proud and she’d
as soon cut her tongue out as give in she was in the
wrong. You’ve made her do more’n I’ve ever made her
do, and how you’ve done it—well, search me.</p>

<p>“You aren’t gettin’ on with your supper,” said Satan
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve had enough. I was wondering if she has her
boots for going through that bush stuff.”</p>

<p>“She’s got them all right. They were in the dinghy:
she didn’t bring them aboard. You’re worryin’ a lot
about the kid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
“Well, maybe. She’s the jolliest kid I ever struck, and
I don’t want any harm to come to her; the pluckiest, too.
There’s not many people would go off alone in the dark
like that in a place like this.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless your soul!” said Satan. “That’s nothin’,
no more than walkin’ down the street to Jude. Do you
think sailin’ these seas is all fair-weather work? Why,
we’ve been rubbin’ our noses in <em>des</em>truction since she was
born. She don’t know what fear is.”</p>

<p>“I could tell that from her face.”</p>

<p>“It’s her face that’s troublin’ me,” said Satan. “Pass
me the water pitcher, will you? She’s begun to take
after mother. A few months ago she was the homeliest
little pup ever littered; but she’s beginnin’ to pick up in
looks, and if she takes after her mother’s side in looks
and ways—Lord save us!”</p>

<p>“Was your mother good looking?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “I don’t know what you call good
looks. Pap said she was a nacheral calamity; that was
after she’d bolted with the Baptis’ man. It wasn’t the
looks so much as the somethin’ about her that’d make a
blind man rubber after her if she passed him in the
street, that’s what Pap said. He never said no prayers,
but when he was talkin’ of Jude I’ve heard him say time
and again, ‘Thank the Lord she don’t take after her
mother!’ and now it’s comin’ out, same as the ace of
spades a shark has hid up his sleeve—and what’s comin’
after, Lord only knows.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I scarce know myself, but Pap said those sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of women couldn’t help bein’ nacheral calamities, attractin’
chaps and turnin’ the world upside down. He
said a man, once they’d got the clutch on him, was no
more use than a hypnotized fowl, whatever that is.
You’ve heard what Jude said about skirts—well, I’m
thinkin’ that’s all baby talk, an’ it’s my ’pinion when she
gets her nacheral sailing orders she’ll be into skirts some
day, same as a dude takes to water, and hypnotizing
chaps, same as her mother before her.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised,” said Ratcliffe; “but I don’t
think she’ll be a natural calamity. I think, from what
I have seen of her, that she has a fine character, honest
as the day, good as gold.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Satan; “but you never know what a
woman is, seems to me, till she’s been rubbed against a
man. Those were Pap’s words and he’d got a headpiece
on him. Well, I reckon time will tell.”</p>

<p>They went on deck.</p>

<p>The moon had not risen yet, and the island lay like a
humped shadow in the starlight. To seaward the anchor
light of the <i>Natchez</i> showed a yellow point, and from the
beach came the lullaby of little waves falling on the sand.</p>

<p>“Now if it wasn’t these days,” said Satan, “I’d be in
two minds about putting out straight now, rather than
lyin’ all night by that feller Cleary.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by these days?”</p>

<p>“Well, in the old throat-cuttin’ days I reckon Cleary
would have gone through us, sunk the old <i>Sarah</i>, and
taken me aboard his hooker with a gun at my head to
make me show him the way to the wreck; but things is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
different now. Fellers are afraid of the law. Cark’s
mortally afraid of the law, so’s Cleary.”</p>

<p>“What time do you start tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“After sun-up, if the wind holds.”</p>

<p>“It will be a joke if we find Carquinez at the reef.
What will he say, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Cark? Oh, he’ll not mind. There ain’t no shame in
Cark. He’ll have broke his contrac’ by not goin’ to
Havana, he’ll stand proved to the eyes as a damn cheat.
He won’t mind: the contrac’ not bein’ regular, the law
can’t have him.”</p>

<p>“I expect Cleary will go for him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Satan. “Then we’ll have some fun.
There’s Jude.”</p>

<p>Something like a swimming water rat was breaking the
star shimmer on the sea. It was the dinghy.</p>

<p>Jude was sculling it from behind, noiselessly. It came
alongside to starboard like a ghost, and with it came Jude’s
voice calling for the tackle. Then the sack came aboard
and after it Jude.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve done it smart,” said Satan, “and no mistake.
Now off down with you and have your supper.
We’ve got to start bright and early in the morning.”</p>

<p>Jude said nothing. Her anger and irritability seemed
to have departed. She kicked off her boots, hitched up
her trousers, and started down below.</p>

<p>“She never keeps a grudge up,” said Satan.</p>

<p>Away in the middle of the night Ratcliffe was
awakened by a stifled scream, the voice of Satan promptly
following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
“Wake up! What ails you?”</p>

<p>“For the Land’s sake, where am I?”</p>

<p>“In your hammock. What’re you dreamin’ of?”</p>

<p>“Gee-owsts.”</p>

<p>“Hants, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Black faces they had, and they was chasin’ me round
and round them trees.”</p>

<p>“That’s what comes of stuffin’ yourself and goin’ to
bed on top of it. Get off your back and onto your side.
Wakin’ a body up like that! What was they like?”</p>

<p>“The hants?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“I can’t be talkin’ for fear of wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p>“He’s asleep. I hear him snorin’. What was they
like?”</p>

<p>“They’d black faces and tails like cows—an’ I’d rather
not be talkin’ of them.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what it means dreamin’ of them things?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ good—bad weather, most like.”</p>

<p>“Glass is steady.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we’ll bust on a reef or somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shet your head!”</p>

<p>“Shet yours. I’m wantin’ to get asleep.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe could hear the water outside tickling the ribs
of the old <i>Sarah</i>. A bigger swell was running, and she
rose to it with balloon-like buoyancy. A score of little
voices from the trickle and slap of the sea against the
timbers to the click of the rudder chain marked her
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
The idea of the ghosts chasing Jude round the dream
tree reminded him of how he had chased her round the
real tree and kissed her—kissed her out of irritation.</p>

<p>Something in his half-asleep state told him he had been
a fool to do that. It was all done in play, just as a little
boy might kiss a little girl; but he was not a little boy.
What had prompted him?</p>

<p>Then as he lay dissolving into slumber the groaning
timbers of the <i>Sarah</i> said something that sounded like
“nacheral calamity,” and then, the door of sleep flung
wide, he was walking on a blazing beach with Cleary.</p>

<p>The <i>Natchez</i> and the <i>Juan</i> were at anchor out on the
blue dream sea, a great wreck was heaved up on the sands,
and when they reached it Cleary tapped on the timbers
and said something about a “nacheral calamity,” and at
the words a porthole opened and Jude’s fresh young face
appeared laughing, framed by the timbers of the wreck.</p>

<p>It seemed to him the most delightful vision—then it
popped in and the porthole closed and Carquinez came
riding up on a horse, saying he was going to “bu’st” the
wreck open with dynamite to get at the treasure.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="subhead">UNDER WAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">He</span> was routed out before dawn by Satan. The
cabin lamp was lit, the table spread, and Jude was
bringing in coffee. She seemed in a bad temper, and
as he huddled himself into his clothes he could hear her:</p>

<p>“Knockin’ myself about in the dark! That old slush
lamp in the galley don’t burn worth a cent. What you
want haulin’ out this hour for?”</p>

<p>And to her Satan:</p>

<p>“Wind will be up with the sun—where’s them biscuits?
We’ve got to get the dinghy aboard yet, and all that
raffle forward stowed, and it’ll be light enough in another
ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Rat?”</p>

<p>“He’s comin’.”</p>

<p>He sat down to table opposite Jude. She scarcely gave
him good morning. The face that had looked so well
framed by the porthole of the dream ship was cross, almost
sullen. He thought for a moment that her ill-temper
was directed toward Satan as well as himself;
then, in some subtle way, he knew it wasn’t. Early rising
may have helped; but he was the cause. What had
he done? He could not think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
He remembered how she had acted when he had stood
up for her the night before. It was just the same this
morning.</p>

<p>Satan said the coffee was burnt,—tasted like bud
barley, and ought to be slung in the slush tub. Ratcliffe
stood up for the coffee, but was cut short by Jude.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s beastly,” said Jude; “but I haven’t
more’n two hands to be gettin’ the things on the table
and the coffee boiled—and some folks snoring in their
bunks!”</p>

<p>“Shet up!” said Satan, ruffled at this wanton attack on
the guest “And talkin’ of snorin’, I reckon you can give
any man points and beat him, once you lay down to it
Why, you shake the ship so that I’ve woke often of
nights thinkin’ we’d got adrift and was dudderin’ over
sandbanks.”</p>

<p>“Lord love you for a liar!” was all Jude said. She
refused help in clearing away the things, joining them on
deck a few minutes later, just as day was coming into
the eastern sky.</p>

<p>The problem of how to get the dinghy aboard had not
occurred to Ratcliffe till now. The <i>Sarah Tyler</i> possessed
no davits, and though the old canvas boat was easy
to handle as an umbrella, the sturdy little dinghy was a
different matter.</p>

<p>Standing in the half-dark with a faint wind bringing
the smell of the early morning sea, sharp as the smell
of a new-drawn sword, he questioned Satan on the
subject.</p>

<p>“Get her aboard?” said Satan. “Oh, I’ll durn soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
get her aboard. Davits! God love you! what do you
want them things for?”</p>

<p>“Except for hoistin’ fools off the ship?” said the voice
of Jude from the darkness. “<em>Air</em> you goin’ to get a move
on? You’ve got the old awning to take in and stow.
Maybe you’ve forgotten it.”</p>

<p>They got the awning down and stowed, and then,
against a train of fire crawling on the eastern sea-line and
in a light that made the world like the vestibule of
Fairyland, Satan set to on the problem of the dinghy.
He had no doubt half a dozen dodges for the purpose.
The one he employed was simply to unshackle the main
halyards and fix them to the ring-bolt on the bow.</p>

<p>As they hauled on the tackle, and as if in answer to the
creak of block and shrill chantey started by Satan, the
races of the gulls blazed out. The deep-sea fishing gulls
had long since started for sea; but the shore gulls, as
though waiting for a convoy to follow, were round the
stern of the <i>Sarah</i>. Then, the dinghy secured, the throat
and peak halyards were manned, and the mainsail rose
slatting against the splendor of the morning.</p>

<p>The sun was over the sea-line now, the wind rising
to meet him, and to starboard the fresh blue sea flooding
against the wind showed the <i>Natchez</i>, her canvas
rising and the fellows swarming at the ropes.</p>

<p>Satan had unlashed the wheel and was standing by it,
now that the mainsail was set, shouting directions to his
crew; and to Ratcliffe, as he labored with Jude getting
the foresail and jib on her, the truth came in a flash
that this was the real thing. The lazy peace of the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
couple of days had broken all at once. Activity, Adventure,
and Danger seemed suddenly to have boarded the
old <i>Sarah Tyler</i> and delivered her as a prey to enormous
and unknown forces.</p>

<p>He had never recognized till now the potential energy
of canvas. The mainsail seemed horribly vast, out of
all proportion to the hull; the slatting of the jib as they
raised it spoke of an energy new born, viewless, and
seeming to have little relationship to the warm and benign
breeze.</p>

<p>But he had no time to think. The anchor was still
to be had in, and as he helped with Jude at the windlass—Pap’s
patent that would have raised a battleship—the
threshing of the canvas with all sheets slack and the
voice of Satan came urging speed.</p>

<p>Then, when the old killick was aboard and the sails
trimmed, came Peace. With the wind on the starboard
beam and the canvas hard against the blue the <i>Sarah</i>
settled down to her work, Palm Island fading to westward,
and to sou’west the <i>Natchez</i> with all sail set in
pursuit.</p>

<p>Jude’s bad temper seemed to have blown away on
the wind, the surly look had gone from her face, and as
she stood for a moment by Ratcliffe, looking over the
weather rail, her mind seemed entirely occupied by
Cleary.</p>

<p>“He’s blowing along,” said Jude; “but he’s feeling our
pace. Not more than holding his own—and he had the
cheek to tell me once his old tub could sail circles round
the <i>Sarah</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Satan at the wheel cocked his eye over his shoulder
at the <i>Natchez</i>, spat, and refixed his gaze on the binnacle.</p>

<p>“Where’s your eyes?” asked Satan.</p>

<p>“In my head,” replied Jude. “What you gettin’ at?”</p>

<p>“He’s overhaulin’ us. Wonder he ain’t aboard! Time
you was gettin’ that anchor up and handlin’ the jib.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe was about to share the blame when, remembering
the incident of the coffee, he checked himself and
held his peace.</p>

<p>Satan was right. The <i>Natchez</i> had the pace of the
<i>Sarah</i>, at least under present wind conditions and under
plain sail. The two boats had evidently never been
matched before, and the gloom of the Tylers might have
been gaged by their silence. Satan did not want to run
away from Cleary; but he had promised him a “lead,”
and this impudent display of the better sailing qualities
of the <i>Natchez</i> was like a derisive underscore to the
promise.</p>

<p>Cleary, in this matter at least, was a very unwise man.
He should have checked the speed of his boat by mishandling
her or even trailing a drogher. Instead of that
he held on, determined, evidently, to take the shine out
of the <i>Sarah</i> and pour derision on the head of Satan.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, little as he knew of boatcraft, felt the situation.
Being wise, he said nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jude spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s her beams helping her. Try her on a wind and
we’d knock flinders out of her. Lord! to think of being
beat by that old cod boat! Say, cayn’t we do nothin’,
crack on a balloon jib or somethin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Satan laughed a mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>“S’much as to tell the cuss we’re beat. Don’t you
think Cleary’s got no balloon jibs up his sleeve? Hain’t
you no sense?”</p>

<p>They held on, the <i>Natchez</i> steadily overhauling them
till she was dead level half a mile away and drawing
ahead.</p>

<p>Then, having demonstrated her superiority, she began
to reduce sail so as to give the <i>Sarah</i> the lead.</p>

<p>Jude turned away and leaned with her back against the
rail; then Satan told her to take the wheel and went below
for a “wash.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STEERSMAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Ratcliffe,</span> taking his seat on the bottom of the
dinghy, watched her as she steered, the old panama
on the back of her head and her eyes roving from the
binnacle to the luff of the mainsail. The following wind
blew warm, and the gentle creak of a block, the slash of
the bow-wash, and the occasional click of the rudder
chain were the only sounds in all the blue world ringing
them.</p>

<p>A mile or more behind them the <i>Natchez</i> showed, a
triangle of pearl, Palm Island had vanished, and nothing
remained in all the wheel of sea but a trace of smoke
to the southward,—the smoke of some freighter hull down
on the horizon.</p>

<p>The sturdy little figure at the wheel seemed to have
forgotten his existence. He was wondering whether the
grudge was still being kept up against him, and what it
was all about, and whether this indifference was real or
assumed, when a voice made him start:</p>

<p>“Say! Have you swallowed your tongue?”</p>

<p>“No, but I didn’t like to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
“Well, I’ve heard you mustn’t speak to the man at the
wheel.”</p>

<p>“Who stuffed you with that yarn?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve seen it stuck up on steamboats, and besides
I thought you were in a temper with me.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Well, you said davits were only good for hoisting
fools off a ship.”</p>

<p>“So they are.”</p>

<p>“I thought you meant me.”</p>

<p>“Thought you was a fool, did you?”</p>

<p>“Then last night you got in a wax—Jude.”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Nothing—only—we don’t want to quarrel—and we
haven’t been the same since last night, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. You wouldn’t let me help to clear
the things this morning.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I? Well, you can help to steer the ship
now. Kin you steer?”</p>

<p>“Only a boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s easy learnt, and you’re not much use aboard
unless you can take your hand at the wheel.”</p>

<p>He said nothing for a minute, admiring the way she
had steered clear of the subject he had started on.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said he at last. “I’ll learn some time—you
can teach me.”</p>

<p>Jude let her eyes rest on him. Then suddenly, and
with the vehemence and force of a Methodist preacher
driving home a point from the pulpit, she spoke:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
“<em>Air</em> you stuck to the bottom of that dinghy with
cobbler’s wax?”</p>

<p>He laughed and stood up.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Jude. “Now come’n take the
wheel. Some time’s no time! You’ve got to learn to
handle her now if you want to. Go behind me and look
over my shoulder—that’s right.”</p>

<p>He stood behind her, wondering what the next command
would be. It came almost at once.</p>

<p>“Stick your eye on the compass card.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“S’long as the pointer’s like that she’s on her course.
Now I’ll let her off a spoke or two—keep your eye on
the card.”</p>

<p>The pointer altered its indication, and the mainsail
seemed suddenly attacked by the ague.</p>

<p>“Now she’s on her course again,” said Jude, altering
the wheel. “Take hold of her. I’ll stand by to give you
a hand if you want it.”</p>

<p>He took the spokes she had been holding as she relinquished
them, and the first sensation that came to him
was the feeling that he had taken hold of something alive,
something alive and sensitive as a hare. The wheel
seemed to have a motive power and will of its own, and
the infernal compass card to take affront at the least
movement of the helm.</p>

<p>Jude rested her hand on his left hand to show him
how and give him confidence, and at the touch of her
firm little hand the stage-fright that comes to every steersman
when he first takes the wheel left him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
In five minutes he had got the hang of the thing, or
thought so.</p>

<p>“Can you run her alone?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“Rather! It’s as simple as simple.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Jude.</p>

<p>She drew off and took her seat on the dinghy.</p>

<p>“Easy, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Easy as pie.”</p>

<p>The wind freshened a bit, and the <i>Sarah</i>, heeling
slightly, took matters in her own hand for a moment
and fell off her course. He put the wheel over too
much, and like a frightened horse she went plunging
away in the opposite direction, the wind spilling from
her sails and the main boom threatening to swing to
port.</p>

<p>In a moment Jude was beside him, her hands on the
spokes, and the <i>Sarah</i> on her course again.</p>

<p>A voice came from below, where Satan, like a sensitive
plant, had evidently felt the alteration in their course.</p>

<p>“What the —— are you doin’ up there?”</p>

<p>“Learning Rat to steer,” cried Jude.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, himself again, retaking the wheel, turned to
her.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake,” said he, “don’t call me that!”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“Rat.”</p>

<p>“For the land’s sake what’s the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a beastly name. If you want something short,
call me what everyone else calls me.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
“Bobby.”</p>

<p>“You’re lettin’ her off again,” said Jude. “Starboard—that’s
it. Here’s Satan: he’ll go on learnin’ you. I’m
goin’ below for a wash.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="subhead">LONE REEF</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was the morning of the third day out, somewhere
about four o’clock. The moon had set, and the
<i>Sarah</i> was lifting against a gentle head sea, boosting the
foam from her bows under the light of a million stars.</p>

<p>Satan was at the wheel, Jude below in her hammock,
and Ratcliffe at the weather rail, close to Satan. He
was leaning over watching the water,—gouts and lines
of star-shot foam, planes of ebony blackness, and now
and then, deep down, the bloom of phosphorus like the
life in the heart of a black opal.</p>

<p>“What time do you reckon we’ll strike the reef?” asked
Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“We’re right on to it now,” replied Satan, “and if it
wasn’t more’n a five-knot breeze I’d heave her to.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t afraid of running on it?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! There’s no smell of it yet.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say you could smell it?”</p>

<p>“Waal,” said Satan, “I don’t know if it’s rightly smell
or hearin’ or what, but I’d know it, even with the wind
as she is. I reckon it’s maybe the water. Shoal water
smells different from deep, and it’s shoal water right up
from four miles to Lone. Feels different too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“More choppy—I dunno—different. Jude would tell
you the same. Pap had the sense of it too. Western
ocean folks can smell ice miles off when the bergs are
cruisin’ about. I reckon it’s the same thing— There’s
the sun.”</p>

<p>Right ahead, as if touched by a wizard, the stars had
faded above the sea line, the sky over there looked sick,
a stain on the velvety splendor of the night.</p>

<p>A great gull passed the <i>Sarah</i>, flying topmast high, and
now far off and as though coming through a pinhole
could be heard a creaky lamentable sound,—the crying
of gulls.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the smell of her now,” said Satan. “Them
gulls you’re hearin’ aren’t all of them from Lone.
There’s a big spit to east’ard, and they’ll be comin’ up
against the wind. Say, will you take a bet?”</p>

<p>“What sort?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you even dollars Cleary hasn’t held on same
as we’ve done the last six hours. He was droppin’ astern
a long way last time I sighted him. He’ll have seen the
reef on the chart right ahead of him, and his navigation
is no account: hasn’t no sea sense. He’ll be hove to
singin’ ‘Lead, kindly light’ and listenin’ for the breakers—What
you say?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather bet on the <i>Sarah</i>.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right,” said Satan.</p>

<p>The head sails showed hard now against the east, and
almost before one could turn and look again the blaze
had come above a band of opal-tinted mist which passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and vanished, leaving on the horizon a train of fire pale
as guinea gold.</p>

<p>In that moment, far ahead and as if suddenly sketched
by a pencil against the eastern light, they saw the naked
spars of a vessel anchored in the dawn.</p>

<p>“That’s Cark,” said Satan. “Told you we’d find him
here—damn swab!”</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t have believed it,” said Ratcliffe. He
remembered the sailing of the <i>Juan</i>, presumably for
Havana, and though he had sized up Sellers and
Carquinez for what they were worth, still, the evidence
of their duplicity, here before his eyes, came as a shock.</p>

<p>In a moment it was blotted out by the sun, washed
away in the blazing, seething ocean of light that sprang
on them as if to the blast of a trumpet.</p>

<p>Satan swung his head over his shoulders. Ratcliffe
followed his gaze. The sea to westward was empty, not
a sign of a sail.</p>

<p>“Cleary’s gone,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be nosin’ along soon,” said Satan. “He’s
sure to come close enough to see Cark’s topmasts, and
then he’ll pounce.”</p>

<p>He put the helm over, and the <i>Sarah</i> payed off to the
north so as to round the northern spur of the reef.</p>

<p>“That’s the wreck,” said Satan, “that line like a lump
of rock.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, shading his eyes, could now see the reef, long
and foam-flecked, stretching from north to south, the line
of rock absolutely unsuggestive of a wreck, beyond the
reef the <i>Juan’s</i> masts and spars, and about the reef-spurs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the gulls flitting and wheeling; but, despite the movement
of the gulls and the splendor of the morning, the place
struck him as the most desolate he had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Nothing stirring,” said Satan, as they rounded the
north spur and the boom came over. “Them lowsy
Spaniards are all in their bunks. Rap on the deck for
Jude. Hi, Jude, y’lazy dog, show a leg! What you
doin’!”</p>

<p>“Comin’,” cried a voice, followed by the sounds of
thrashing about and inquiries of the Lord to know where
her clothes were.</p>

<p>Then at the hatch appeared a face blind with sleep.
She ran with Ratcliffe to get the lashings off the anchor,
helped to let go the halyards, and as the anchor fell and
the <i>Sarah</i> swung to her moorings a couple of cable lengths
from and outside the <i>Juan</i>, down she sat on the deck like
a person collapsing under a heavy load.</p>

<p>The sight of the <i>Juan</i> did not seem to move her at
all. Like a dormouse suddenly electrified into life and
movement, the stimulus withdrawn, the mechanism ceased
to act. She yawned, turned on her side, and hid her face
in the crook of her arm as if to shut out the sun. Satan,
whistling between his teeth, stood with his hands on the
rail looking at the <i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>“They’re wakin’ up,” said he.</p>

<p>A fellow with a red handkerchief round his head had
appeared on deck. He came and looked over the side
at the <i>Sarah</i>, then vanished.</p>

<p>“Gone to wake Cark out of his beauty sleep,” said
Satan. “Look! There’s two more of them movin’ about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
like sick flies. Will you look at the way they’ve stowed
them sails?—and they’ve got her a sight too close to the
reef. Get a Western Ocean sea suddenly runnin’ and the
anchor to drag, where’d they be?”</p>

<p>He turned and contemplated the prostrate figure of
Jude.</p>

<p>“There’s another sleepin’ beauty,” said he. “Ought
a be married to Cark. Well they’d look in the same
hammock with Sellers fannin’ the flies off them!”</p>

<p>The figure on the deck turned on its back, stretched
out its arms, yawned, and then sat up holding its knees.</p>

<p>Youth may sneer at Age; but, anyhow, Age knows
nothing of the weariness of Youth, of a morning.</p>

<p>Satan, satisfied with the semi-resurrection, dropped below,
and promptly the figure fell on its back again with
arms outspread.</p>

<p>“Get up!” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“I’m getting— Say!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I—ow—yow—ain’t it awful bein’ tired?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be all right when you’re on your feet. Get
up!”</p>

<p>“I’m getting— Say, d’you know where the fishing
lines are? Starboard locker. Fetch’m up, an’ that
chunk of grouper I kep’ for bait—in the tub.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>When he returned on deck she was drying her head
in the sun, having soused it in a bucket of water.</p>

<p>Then they dropped a line.</p>

<p>Away through the diamond-clear water, thirty feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
down, they could see the slack of the anchor chain like
a conger on the coral and sponge.</p>

<p>A nurse shark passed like a grisly ghost, then a shoal
of sardines, then a young whip ray not bigger than a
soup plate, then a mangrove schnapper that nosed the
bait, swallowed it, and was hauled on board.</p>

<p>“He’ll be enough,” said Jude. “You clean him while
I get the frying pan ready. Hullo! blest if Cark’s not
putting off a boat!”</p>

<p>A boat had been dropped on the starboard side of the
<i>Juan</i> and was rounding her stern.</p>

<p>“That’s Sellers,” said Jude, shading her eyes. “Satan!
Below there!”</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Sellers is coming off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be up in a minute.”</p>

<p>The boat came alongside, just as it had come at Palm
Island,—same boat, same crew, Sellers just the same.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Kid!” cried Sellers.</p>

<p>“Hullo yourself! Thought you was gone to Havana.”</p>

<p>“Thought you was to wait for us at Pa’m Island,” said
Sellers. “Hullo, Satan, that you? How about your contrac’
with us?”</p>

<p>Satan, who had just come on deck, leaned over the rail
and contemplated Sellers. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“God A’mighty!” said Satan. He stared at Sellers for
a moment as one might stare at a prodigy. Then he
broke out:</p>

<p>“Contrac’! Holy George! <em>What</em> you say, contrac’?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
You daar to hook onto my channel plates, and I’ll buzz
this fish at y’r head! Shove off! What are you doin’
here, anyway? Why aren’t you at Havana gettin’ the
dynamite?”</p>

<p>“Why ain’t you waitin’ for us at Pa’m Island?”
logically responded Sellers. “If you want to know why
we’re here. I’ll tell you. It was a bet I had with Cark.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“I bet him you’d never wait for us at Pa’m Island,
but’d light out for here to raise the stuff if we went
foolin’ off to Havana. Seems I was right, don’t it?”</p>

<p>The impudence of this made Ratcliffe gasp, but left
Satan quite unmoved.</p>

<p>“S’pose we quit lyin’,” said he.</p>

<p>“I’m willin’ to follow soot,” replied Sellers.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Satan, “follow soot off to the wreck
an’ get your workin’ party onto the business like hot
nails. I’ll be over to help you soon’s we’ve had breakfast.
You’ve no time to waste.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Cleary’s after you.”</p>

<p>This news seemed to take the wind out of Sellers.
He sat for a moment without speaking.</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” asked he at length.</p>

<p>“He put into Palm Island not more’n four hours after
you’d gone; said you and Cark had tricked him and he
was after your blood. I told him that wasn’t no concern
of mine. He asked me had I seen you.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
“The truth. Think I’d perjure me soul lyin’ for the
likes of you and Cark? Told him I was goin’ to join
you.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sufferin’</em> Moses! You’ve put your hoof in it this
time! Go on and don’t stand waggin’ your tail! What’d
he say?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’, didn’t say nothin’, but when I put out he
put out after me.”</p>

<p>“Followed you?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I only lost him last night; but it’s ten to one
he’ll drop on us. He’ll be bustin’ everywhere round
here.”</p>

<p>“He will,” said Sellers, “and then it’s half shares he’ll
be wantin’, not to mention Cark’s liver. I’m sweatin’!
Cark’s let that chap down cruel. I owns it. Did it
against my advice. Did he have many with him?”</p>

<p>“Reckon so. The old <i>Natchez</i> was full as a beehive
with the toughest-lookin’ crowd.”</p>

<p>The sight of Sellers’ face at this announcement set
Jude off. She seized the fish and started off to the galley
with it, while Sellers, having communed with himself
for a moment, spoke:</p>

<p>“Crooked’s a bad course to run,” said this moralist.
“I’ve always told Cark so. I told you we’d no dynamite
aboard,—neither we had,—but there’s a keg of powder in
the hold, and Cark reckoned to sample the goods without
your help. There, it’s out! You’d have had your
share as long as I’d a leg to stand on, honest you would,
s’far as I was concerned, and that’s all I have to say
pers’nally on the matter. What I’m gettin’ at is this: If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Cleary turns up, there’ll be hell of a rough-house. Will
you stand for us if there’s fightin’ to be done?”</p>

<p>“That depends,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“I’m not trustin’ you no more, not without the coin in
my hand. Cark’s got to plank down something on account,
if it’s no more’n a thousand dollars. If he don’t,
I’ll put out for Havana and blow the gaff. You’ve overhauled
the wreck?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can judge what the chances are. You hop
back lively as a flea and tell Cark what I’m sayin’. Gold
coin and right into my fist this mornin’, or I’ll give the
show away. It’s his own doin’. If he’d played straight
with me, I’d have trusted him. Seein’ he’s played
crooked, he’ll have to pay. One thousand dollars, or I
go back to Havana and you’ll have a t’pedoboat on top
of you, to say nothin’ of Cleary!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him,” said Sellers. “Come over to the reef
soon as you’re ready and I’ll give you word of what he
says. I reckon it’ll be all right. One thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“Gold coin, and tell him it’ll be double after eleven
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t kick,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>The boat shoved away.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe remembered what Satan had said about the
chart and the hidden writing in it and the high probability
that the bones of the <i>Nombre de Dios</i> were lying
elsewhere than here. More than ever did it seem to him
that Satan was the spider of this web,—not a malignant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
spider, for the flies he was catching in the form of
Carquinez and Sellers, and possibly Cleary, were the
weavers of the web, in which they seemed tangling themselves.
Satan only fell in with circumstance and took
toll.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said he. “Suppose Carquinez pays you
a thousand dollars’ advance, and suppose you don’t find
any treasure, will you pay him back?”</p>

<p>“Why should I pay him back?” asked Satan. “I’ve
given him the location, and that’s worth a thousand anyway.”</p>

<p>“But you said there was nothing on the chart, that it
was a fake.”</p>

<p>“Lord! I said no such thing. I said that in my
’pinion the stuff wasn’t here; but I may be wrong.
There’s Jude hollering for us to come to breakfast.
Come along down and I’ll show you my meanin’.”</p>

<p>He scarcely spoke during the meal, and when it was
over he took the tobacco box from his pocket and opened
the chart on the table.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Satan, “I’ll show you what I mean by
sayin’ the stuff may be here, but it’s a big sight larger
maybe it isn’t. Don’t crowd me. Stand behind me on
either side and keep your eyes on the chart. Well, now,
there’s Lone Reef with the creek marked and the name
of her, and there’s Rum Cay to the left, and there’s the
latitude and longitude wrote up—all plain, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, seein’ Rum Cay is given, and seein’ Lone Reef
is down on all the charts and as well known as Cuba<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
to any sailor man, what did the man want stickin’ the
latitude and longitude down for? The chart’s not a
sailin’ chart. A blind monkey wouldn’t use it nor bother
about examinin’ the latitude and longitude wrote on it.
He’d just say, ‘Lone Reef is the place I want to get to,’
and he’d get there with the ordinary ship’s chart.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “in my opinion the chap that sank
the <i>Nombre de Dios</i> knew of the old wreck lyin’ over
there on Lone Reef and used it as a blind, for the latitude
and longitude wrote there so faint that no man
would bother to try to read it isn’t the latitude and longitude
of Lone Reef; it’s a hundred and ten mile out. It’s
the latitude and longitude of Cormorant Cay, a blasted
sandbank down to s’uthard, all shoals and gulls, and that’s
where the <i>Nombre de Dios</i> lies, in my ’pinion.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe whistled.</p>

<p>“Of course I may be wrong,” said Satan, “there’s no
knowin’.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean,” said Ratcliffe. “This chap
reckoned that anyone finding or stealing the chart would
take the latitude and longitude written there for granted
as the latitude and longitude of Lone Reef, and not bother
to examine the figures and verify them; having no cause,
indeed, to do so, seeing Lone Reef is so well known and
on all the charts.”</p>

<p>“That’s how it seems to me,” said Satan. “I’m not
sayin’ I’m right, but that’s how it seems to me, and if
he figured that no one would trouble about readin’ and
verifyin’ the latitude and longitude as given there he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
right. Pap didn’t, and it was only by chance I did, a
month ago.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Cormorant Cay?”</p>

<p>“Lord, yes! It’s a lagoon sandspit, and the hooker
may be in the lagoon for all I know, or under the sand
for all I know, or I may be wrong all through and that
may be her on the reef over there. Well, we’ve got to
see; but it seems to me I’m pretty safe anyway, if I can
touch Cark for that thousand.”</p>

<p>So thought Ratcliffe.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WRECK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">After</span> breakfast, leaving Jude to keep ship, they
got the dinghy overboard and rowed for the reef.
Here to eastward the landing was made easy by a scrap
of beach a hundred yards long, where the boat of the
<i>Natchez</i> was lying, having landed Sellers and his working
party.</p>

<p>Satan, scrambling, led the way over the rocks to the
central creek between the two reef arms, where, ponded
round with water, lay the wreck.</p>

<p>The reef, seen from the deck of the <i>Sarah</i>, showed
little sign of a wreck. One had to land on it to discover
that the long hogback of rock rising from the creek had
structure. There was not even the indication of where
a mast had been, bowsprit there was none, stem and stern
were almost indistinguishable; yet, standing there, with
the gulls flying round him and the lonely tune of the sea
in his ears, Ratcliffe knew that the thing he was gazing
upon was a ship. Structure speaks! You can destroy
it, but can scarcely disguise it.</p>

<p>Between the right arm of the reef and the starboard
bow of the hulk a ridge of rock gave access to the deck,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and as the others crossed over he took his seat to rest
for a moment and contemplate the thing before him.</p>

<p>To see the Sphinx properly, one should visit it alone,
and so with the great wreck of the <i>Nombre de Dios</i>,—if
that were its name,—crouching here, camouflaged with
rock-growth and weed, swollen, sinister in the blazing
sunlight, and sung to by the chime and gurgle of the sea.</p>

<p>Sunk in shallow water,—so the tale ran,—raised by
that alteration in level constantly in progress among the
reefs and islands, freighted with treasure, and guilty of
the death of many a man—well, the tale here rang true.
On board the <i>Sarah</i> one might doubt, but here, even in
face of that chart which seemed faked, one believed,—mainly,
perhaps, because one wanted to believe.</p>

<p>Here, sitting on the reef, one became part of the story,
just as when the lights of the theater are lowered one
becomes part of the play. The flower-blue sky, the
sapphire sea, the tepid wind, the shouting gulls, all became
confederates. One saw, in the far past, the <i>Nombre
de Dios</i> setting sail,—the tragic figure of Lopez on her
quarterdeck; the sinking of her in shallow, reef-strewn
water; the escape in the boats; men dying of starvation;
the lapse of years; Lopez dying with her secret still
hidden; and Lone Reef rising still higher out of the sea
to expose more fully the murdered ship.</p>

<p>The reef had always been here, for it was down in the
oldest charts. Had it really risen? Was that chart, as
Satan supposed, a lie?</p>

<p>According to Sellers’ story, the <i>Nombre de Dios</i> had
been sunk in six-fathom water, thirty-six-foot. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
if that was so, Satan was right, for the highest point of
the reef was only six feet above water, and when she was
sunk the reef would have been thirty feet under water
and so uncharted.</p>

<p>There was the chance that Lopez might have sailed her
into the creek, deeper in those days, and that the creek
bottom might have raised itself to its present level, the
reef remaining the same. This seemed unlikely.</p>

<p>And yet the decks must have been under water once,
to account for the old coral deposits.</p>

<p>It was low tide in the creek now: high-tide mark was
six feet below the deck level. He tried to calculate how
far she must have been lifted, gave up the attempt, and,
rising, crossed by the rock bridge to her deck.</p>

<p>This bridge of rock was another factor in the insoluble
problem. It seemed placed there by some marine architect
without reason, built up out of huge fragments as if
from some fallen peak or spire.</p>

<p>“Step careful!” shouted Satan.</p>

<p>The warning came just in time, for the deck was
slippery as ice in patches where a thin moss had grown,—a
gray, greasy moss, treacherous as Death, and covering
the droppings of innumerable sea birds.</p>

<p>He made his way aft, where Sellers was standing with
Satan and the half-dozen Spaniards that formed the
working party. Drills and picks lay about, and marks
showed where work had been started the day before.</p>

<p>“It’s a foot thick,” said Sellers, “whatever it is, and
harder than cement. Rock!—this ain’t coral rock, not
such as I’ve ever seen. Harveyized steel’s more like it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and after that there’s the deck planking to be got
through.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “I told you it was a dynamite job,
and if you’d played fair and got the stuff we’d have been
a long sight nearer the end of the business, even if we
started a week later. But there’s no use in talkin’ now,
and there’s no use in messin’ about pickin’ holes here and
there. Your job is to make a hole big enough to sink
that barrel of powder of yours—take me? Sink it half
deep and then lay a fuse and fire the whole lot at once
and risk chances. It’s ten to one you’ll split the deck
right open at one go. As for sinkin’ little holes and usin’
small charges, you’ll be ten years on the job.”</p>

<p>Sellers rose up and wiped his brow and cast his eyes
over the sea to westward, evidently with Cleary in his
mind.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sure you aren’t right,” said he. “I’ll
fix it that way; but it’ll be a long job with the tools we
have.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Satan. “And now to the question of
them dollars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, them—I’ve spoke to Cark, and he’s agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is he? Well, then. I’ll go right aboard with you
now while he’s warm and get them dollars into my hand.
Set your men at work and you come along with me.”</p>

<p>Sellers hung fire for a moment, then he agreed, gave
the working party their directions, and led the way off
the deck across the rock bridge.</p>

<p>He pushed off with Satan in the boat of the <i>Juan</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Satan asked Ratcliffe to take the dinghy back to the
<i>Sarah</i>.</p>

<p>“You won’t want to be hangin’ about the reef,” said
Satan; “you’ll be more comfortable aboard ship. And tell
Jude to be sure and wash that old jumper I left on the
rail. She’s forgot it, for there it’s hangin’ still.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<span class="subhead">MUTINY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> he sculled up alongside the <i>Sarah</i> there was no
sign of Jude. He tied up the boat and came over
the rail.</p>

<p>“Jude, where are you?”</p>

<p>“What you want?” came a surly voice from below.
She was in the “saloon,” for he could hear her moving
about.</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“Well, you kin go on wantin’. I’m sick!”</p>

<p>“What on earth’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>Pause—then the voice came again mixed with sounds
as of plates being put away.</p>

<p>“I’m sick of the hull of this crowd—washing up and
cooking and you two playin’ about!”</p>

<p>“Come up on deck.”</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t! I’m going to scatter—soon’s I’ve finished
clearing away. Life of a dog!” indistinct grumbles tailing
away into silence.</p>

<p>He lit a pipe and waited.</p>

<p>Presently the companionway creaked and a head appeared
at the cabin hatch. He said nothing while the
whole body emerged, stood erect on the deck, and shaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
its eyes toward the <i>Juan</i>. Then, still speechless, it
leaned on the rail, looking toward the reef and apparently
lost in thought.</p>

<p>The sleeves of the guernsey were rolled up to mid-arm,
ill temper seemed to have vanished and to have been replaced
by sudden laziness, and as she lolled, kicking up a
bare heel, she whistled.</p>

<p>She seemed utterly unconscious of his presence—or
pretending to be. Then her eyes fell to the water alongside
and the dinghy. The whistling ceased and her face
turned to him.</p>

<p>“Say,” said Jude, “where did you learn to tie up
boats?”</p>

<p>He came beside her.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at present, but give her half an hour and
she’d work herself free of that tom-fool knot.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down and retie it.”</p>

<p>“No use in troubling, I’m going off in her in a minute,
and she’ll hang there till I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Never <em>you</em> mind! You’ve been playing about on the
reef, and you’ve got to stick here now and boil the potatoes!
Me alone here all the morning!”</p>

<p>“Why, I wasn’t more than an hour on the reef—and
I never knew you wanted to go. If I had, I shouldn’t
have gone, honestly I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Jude contemplated him a moment with a more friendly
face.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “I’m going, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
“But where to?”</p>

<p>“Gulls-nesting.”</p>

<p>“On the reef?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! To the spit away there to east’ard. You
can’t see it: it’s near seven mile away.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t row there alone.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I? You bet I can, there and back by sundown!”</p>

<p>“But what will Satan say?”</p>

<p>Jude laughed. “He’ll be wild—that’s what I want to
make him. I’ll learn him! Him and his jumpers!”</p>

<p>She took the jumper off the rail, rolled it up and
threw it on the deck, then she dived below and reappeared
with a water jar and some provisions done up in a bundle.
She had evidently been making her preparations.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Ratcliffe. “If you’re going, I’ll go
too.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t!” said Jude. “You’ve got to stick here
and look after the ship—and see how you like it.”</p>

<p>“Not I—I couldn’t face Satan; besides, if you want
to make him wild really, hell be twice as wild if we
both go; besides, I’m sick of the ship. Come on: I’ve
never been gulls-nesting.”</p>

<p>Jude, evidently weakening, put down her bundle.</p>

<p>“Well, there ain’t enough grub for two,” she complained.
“I reckon there’s enough water, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, get some more grub.”</p>

<p>She cast her eyes about in indecision, now at Ratcliffe,
now at the <i>Juan</i>, then, with one of those sudden changes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
so indicative of her, she made up her mind and dived below.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she reappeared with another small
bundle.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, during her absence, had torn the back off
an old letter. He had a pencil in his pocket, and, scrawling
“gone gulls-nesting on the sandspit” on the paper,
stuck the missive to the mast with his penknife.</p>

<p>Then, bundling the food and the water jar into the
dinghy, they started.</p>

<p>He took the sculls at first, Jude steering, her eyes fixed
ahead under the shade of her old panama. She could
tell exactly the spot where the spit lay. She could not
see it, but she could see in the sky now and then over
there a faint trace like a haze of smoke that formed,
vanished and reformed,—gulls.</p>

<p>Occasionally she looked back where the deserted <i>Sarah
Tyler</i> lay, with the <i>Juan</i> seeming now close beside her
and the reef behind them. Smaller and smaller they
grew and more vast the ocean, an infinity of blazing
lazulite, without horizon, silent, but sonorous with light.</p>

<p>The current was with them.</p>

<p>Satan had made a small mast and lug sail for the
dinghy. That was the job he had been engaged on while
Jude and Ratcliffe had landed on Palm Island to get provisions
from the cache. He had worked with all the
care of a fond mother making a garment for a beloved
child. The little mast, scraped and varnished, the sail
made of an extra special bit of stuff wheedled from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Thelusson, were in the boat, and, a breeze now springing
up from the sou’west, Jude gave orders to step the mast.
Then she took the sheet, he slipped from his seat to the
bottom of the boat, and the dinghy, bending to the three-knot
breeze, lifted to the gentle swell.</p>

<p>A great herring hog passed them, plunging like a
dolphin, and a flying fish with blind, staring eyes missed
the sail by a hand’s breadth and flickered into the sea
ahead; then a strange-looking gull swooped toward them
from nowhere, hung for a moment with domed wings,
honey-colored against the sun, and passed with a cry into
the great silence, a silence broken only by the slap and
tinkle of the water against the planking.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe lit his pipe. Jude, steering, seemed to have
forgotten her last trace of grudge against him, forgotten
Satan and the jumper and the fact that she had been
left to her lonesome while they had been playing on the
reef and her desire to cut the whole show and start a
“la’ndry.” She seemed just now a different person, companionable
and friendly and sane, as though the cooking
and cleaning and the worries and troubles of the <i>Sarah</i>
had been lifted like a dish-cover from her prisoned soul.</p>

<p>It was the first time they had been really alone together,
and the companionship that springs from loneliness
helped.</p>

<p>The gull reminded her of gulls she had seen on the
Louisiana coast where the cypress swamps come down
to meet the sea and you could hear “the bullfrogs shoutin’
all night, ‘Paddy got drunk, Paddy got drunk, Paddy
got drunk,’ and the other chaps answering up, ‘Bottle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
rum, bottle of rum, bottle of rum,’ and the ’gaters would
come alongside grinding against the planking sniffing for
bits—ever seen a ’gater?”</p>

<p>“Only stuffed.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in museums and places.”</p>

<p>“What’s them?” asked Jude.</p>

<p>“Oh, places where they keep stuffed birds and animals.”</p>

<p>“Git a bit more to sta’board to trim the boat; <em>sta</em>’board
I said, not port! And what in the nation do they want
keeping them things for?”</p>

<p>“Jude,” said he lazily.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“This is the jolliest time I ever spent. I’ve never felt
free before till just now. I’d like to go sailing round and
round the world in this little dinghy and forget civilization.
That’s the place where they keep stuffed birds to
look at, and stuffed animals in museums, and where the
men and women are stuffed idiots. Do you remember the
morning I came on board the <i>Sarah</i> first?”</p>

<p>“Them pajamas!”</p>

<p>“Yes, them pajamas. Only for them you wouldn’t
have laughed at me, and if you hadn’t laughed at me I
shouldn’t have come aboard, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you would.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Satan wanted you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did he? Bless Satan!—he made me young
again.”</p>

<p>“Lord! you ain’t so old as all that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
“I’m over twenty-one—and you’re only—”</p>

<p>“Raisin’ sixteen,” said Jude, with steady eyes fixed
ahead where the gulls above the spit were now well
visible.</p>

<p>He refilled and lit his pipe, bending under the gunnel.</p>

<p>“You’re mighty fond of that old pipe,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Have a whiff?”</p>

<p>“Not me! I had half a cigar once; Dirk Peterson
dared me. It was one of them wheelings, black, slick-lookin’
cigars. He and me an’ anuther boy’d gone to look
at the nigger girls bathin’ and clod them—”</p>

<p>“Where on earth was that?”</p>

<p>“Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and who was Dirk Peterson?”</p>

<p>“Son of an old feller that run a dridger in the harbor,
Yankee, half-Dutch, hadn’t only one eye, and wasn’t
more’n eleven, biggest liar from here to C’necticut. His
face was all chawed up, and he said he’d got it like that
and lost his eye fightin’ with a tiger. Confl’ent smallpox
was what had done him, so Pap said; but the boys
believed him till that day I was telling you of, he fetched
out a half cigar he’d stole or picked up somewhere and
a box of waxios and dared me smoke her—and I lit her
up, like a durned fool!”</p>

<p>“What happened then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots of things,” said Jude. “First of all the harbor
begun spinnin’, and then it went on till two tides
more I’d have been inside out, when Dirk shouts to some
chaps to come an’ look at Jonah tryin’ to bring up the
whale. That got my goat, and I laid for him by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
foot and brought him down and near beat the head off
him. Then I got sick on him again, and he run home
to his mother, with all the fellers after him wantin’ to
know about that tiger.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t fight?”</p>

<p>“N’more than a jewfish.”</p>

<p>“Have you had many fights with boys?”</p>

<p>“Not me—not with Satan handy to do the fighting.
I’d only to say to one, ‘You touch me and I’ll put Satan
on you,’ and he’d shrivel.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t care to tackle Satan myself,” admitted
Ratcliffe. “And Sellers seemed to think a lot of
him that way, for I heard him asking if he’d stand by if
Cleary showed fight.”</p>

<p>“Garn!” said Jude. “Cleary—he’s no good; Sellers is
no good, neither. There’s not a man in these seas nowadays
that’s got the fight of a tomcat in him. That’s
what Pap used to say. He was great on old times, and
used to string off yarns about the pirates and the high
doin’s there used to be, and he said we were nothing but
a lot of scowbankers now—and that’s the truth! If
Cleary comes up with Cark, they’ll be shaking hands and
kissing one another, feeling in each other’s pockets all
the time to see if they can’t steal five cents. In the old
days they’d have been cutting each other’s throats.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to be a pirate, Jude?”</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>“Murdering people?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ask me another.”</p>

<p>“How’d you like to kiss Cark?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
“How’d you? Hear the gulls!”</p>

<p>The crying of the gulls above the spit was coming up
against the wind, a lamentable sound across the lone blue
sea.</p>

<p>“We’re not more’n a mile away,” said the steersman.
“You can get a sight of the spit if you raise yourself.
That’s it, the white line runnin’ north and south; but the
gulls don’t seem to be as many as they used to be a year
ago. It’s a bit early for the full laying season, but there’s
sure to be turkles’ eggs. Better get your shoes and
stockin’s off and roll up your pants, for it’s shallow beaching
and we’ll have to run her up.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take down the sail and row her in?”</p>

<p>“Not me. There’s no sea on and I’ll run her up as
she is.”</p>

<p>They held on, the gulls shouting over them now, and
the sigh of the sandspit, fuming to the lazy sea, in their
ears. It was full tide, and as the keel touched the sand,
letting the sheet go and the sail to flog in the wind, they
tumbled over and dragged the little boat high and dry.</p>

<p>Then Jude took down the sail.</p>

<p>“You aren’t hungry yet?” said Jude.</p>

<p>“No; are you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can wait. Well leave the grub and the water
jar in the boat and cover them with the sail,—keep
the sun off. Lend’s a hand.”</p>

<p>They covered the provisions, hauled the boat up another
foot or two to make sure, and, that done, Ratcliffe
looked around him.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="subhead">THE SANDSPIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">That</span> was one of the strangest moments in his life.
He had never seen anything comparable to this long
white street of sand curbed with emerald waves, leading
nowhere, lost, useless, desolate, brilliant with a brilliance
that hit the heart as well as the eye, flown over by the
white gulls.</p>

<p>The sands fizzed to the sea wind, and away to north
and south they trembled and waved in the heat; but the
curious thing was the fact that, despite their loneliness,
one did not feel alone. The place seemed populous,
filled with a crowd that for a moment had made itself
invisible. Perhaps it was the riot of color and the
brilliance of light: the effect remained.</p>

<p>Jude, looking round, seemed preoccupied about something.
It was the absence of gulls.</p>

<p>“Last time I was here,” said Jude, “it was all over
gulls’ nests, right here in the middle. Now they seem
to have gone off to the ends. Wonder what’s come to
them?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s too early for them.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit early, but not much: there’s always early
breeders. No, they’ve just took their hook—gulls are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
like that. We’ll have to go and hunt at the ends. You
go north and I’ll go south.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “it’s an awfully long way. Suppose
we have something to eat first?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Jude.</p>

<p>They got the provisions and water jar from the boat
and sat down on the sands. It was past noon and cooler,
for the breeze had livened up, the outgoing tide was
leaving a strip of wet sand glittering like a golden
sword, and the fume of beach filled the air resonant with
the gentle rhythm of the waves.</p>

<p>They ate, leaning on their sides like old Athenians.
They had no cup; so they took it in turns to drink from
the water jar. Then he lit a pipe.</p>

<p>“This is jolly,” said he.</p>

<p>“Ain’t bad,” said Jude.</p>

<p>She made a pillow of sand for her head, and then, on
her back with her head on the pillow, lay like a starfish,
spread-eagled, her hat over her eyes.</p>

<p>He followed suit.</p>

<p>“How about those gulls’ nests?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Which ones?” evaded Jude.</p>

<p>“The ones you were going to hunt for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, them? Well, I reckon there’s dead loads of
time.”</p>

<p>“Lots—listen to the sand!”</p>

<p>“It’s the wind blowing it.”</p>

<p>“I know. All the same this is a rum place. Do you
know when we landed here, just now, the first thing
that struck me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
“Naw.”</p>

<p>“Well, I felt as if the place was full of people.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; people I couldn’t see, ghosts.”</p>

<p>“Hants?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What made y’ think that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Somehow it reminded me of a
story I’d once read.”</p>

<p>“What was the story?”</p>

<p>“About a beach over in the Pacific where wizards used
to go and pick up shells.”</p>

<p>“What’s them?”</p>

<p>“Chaps that work magic and sell themselves to the
devil. They can make themselves invisible so’s you can’t
see them, and they used to come to the beach and pick
up shells, and then turn the shells into silver dollars.
You couldn’t see them, but you could hear them rustling
about, like that sand, and talking to one another,
and now and then you’d see a little fire blaze up.”</p>

<p>Jude, interested, rolled over, rested her chin in her
palms, and kicked a bare heel to the sun.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re not far wrong,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve felt the same way here myself, as if there
was hants about and if you’d turn your head sharp
you’d see someone behind you. Now you’ve talked of
it. I’ll be always thinking it if I come here again. Wish
you’d kept your head shut.”</p>

<p>She sat up and looked about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
“Sorry,” said Ratcliffe, raising himself on his arm;
“but if you come again I’ll come with you, and that’ll
keep the hants off—unless I’m gone.”</p>

<p>“How d’you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, when this cruise is over I’ll have to leave you
both and go home. I don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>Jude said nothing. Staring over the sea under the
brim of her hat, she did not seem to have heard him.</p>

<p>“I’d much sooner stick on here with you and Satan.
What’s that thing floating out there?”</p>

<p>“Turkle,” said Jude. “Look, he’s doing a dive!”</p>

<p>He sat up beside her.</p>

<p>“So he has. Well, he’s gone.” He sat with his knees
up, looking over the sea.</p>

<p>Alone here with Jude she seemed a different person
from what she had been aboard the <i>Sarah</i>. The strange
antagonism she had suddenly exhibited, and a trace of
which had remained up till this morning, seemed to have
utterly vanished. Perhaps it was the “hants,” or the
loneliness, or a combination of both, but she seemed
subdued.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see what you want going for if you
don’t want to,” suddenly said Jude, drawing up her
knees and crossing them with her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” said he. “Don’t let’s think of it; besides,
we’ll fix up something. I don’t want to go. I’ve
never had such a jolly time in my life, and I’m not
going to lose sight of you and Satan—unless you want
to.”</p>

<p>“Lord! I don’t want to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
“Well, that’s all right We’ll stick together, somehow,
and let the old world go hang, and we’ll go hunting
abalones and fishing—let’s make plans.”</p>

<p>His arm somehow slipped round her waist, half automatically,
just as one puts one’s hand on a person’s
shoulder. When he realized what he had done, he realized,
at the same time, that she did not seem to mind;
more than that, she reciprocated in a way by letting her
shoulder rest more comfortably against his. It was
companionship, pure and simple, and her mind seemed
far away, wrapped in the sun-blaze as with a garment,
and wandering—who knows where?</p>

<p>“Heave ahead,” said Jude drowsily. “What’s your
plans?”</p>

<p>“Plans—oh, I’ve lots. Let’s go round the world in the
old <i>Sarah</i>—get a couple more hands.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you stick them?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got a foc’s’le.”</p>

<p>“Not big enough for a tomcat. The nigger filled it.
He said he reckoned he’d got to stick his head through
the hatch to breathe.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get rid of the <i>Sarah</i> and get a bigger
boat.”</p>

<p>“Lord! Don’t you never let Satan hear you say that:
she’s his skin!”</p>

<p>“We’ll do without extra hands, then, and work her,
the three of us. I can steer all right now.”</p>

<p>“Kin you?”</p>

<p>“You know jolly well I can!”</p>

<p>“What’s the points of the compass? Run ’em off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
“North—nor’-nor’east, nor’east—um—”</p>

<p>Jude chuckled subduedly.</p>

<p>“Heave ahead!”</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Never knew.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe.”</p>

<p>The confiding shoulder rested more heavily against
him as against a cushion and she began to hum a tune.
She seemed to have forgotten the points of the compass,
him, everything, just as a child suddenly forgets everything
in day-dream land.</p>

<p>The absolute contentment of doing nothing, resting,
listening to the waves, had fallen upon him too, with a
something else, a sort of mesmerism born of his companion,
the strangest feeling as though Jude were a part
of himself, as though he had put his arm round his own
waist and a new self,—a much pleasanter self than the
old one, less stiff, more human, and somehow more alive.</p>

<p>The metronomic rhythm of the little waves falling on
the sand seemed to mix his thoughts together and blur
them; but he saw Skelton, Sir William Skelton, Bart.,
he saw a girl he, Ratcliffe, had been engaged to, he saw
all sorts of men and all sorts of women, everyone he
had ever known, it seemed to him, in a nebulous cluster,
and they all seemed, somehow, not quite alive,—not dead,
but sleeping in the trance we call civilization, their days
ordered by the beat of a metronome,—get up—wash—dress—eat—work
or play—eat—work or play—eat—work
or play—bed—sleep—get up—wash—dress etc.,—all
the figures moving like one, their very laughter and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
tears ordered except when they got drunk or went mad.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that vivid life was not so much a
question of vitality as of freedom.</p>

<p>Was that the secret Satan had discovered,—Satan,
who had no hankering after great riches, but was free
as a gull? Satan and Jude were gulls,—seagulls, untamable
as seagulls and as far from civilization! It was as
though his arm were round a bird,—quiescent by some
miracle and allowing him to handle it, and imparting
to him, somehow, the knowledge of its vitality,—the
vitality of freedom.</p>

<p>“What I like about the old <i>Sarah</i>,” said he, “is the
way she just pots about—with nothing to do.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to do!”</p>

<p>“Well, you and Satan can take things easy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can we? That’s news—what d’you call easy?”</p>

<p>“You have no fixed work, you can knock off when
you like, you haven’t to carry cargo, or be bothered with
owners, or be up to time. You are as free as the gulls.”</p>

<p>Jude took his hand and removed his arm from around
her waist just as one removes a belt. She wanted to
shift her position. She seemed to have lost interest in
the conversation. Sand had got between her toes, and
she removed it, running her finger between them. She
had no handkerchief,—never used one or needed to use
one: the perfectly healthy animal never does.</p>

<p>Then, crossing her legs like a tailor and squatting in
front of him, she dived into the right hand pocket of
her trousers and produced a dollar, a slick, evil, suspicious-looking
dollar. She seemed utterly to have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the gulls’-nesting business and how the time was
running on, and having little passion for the business
he was content not to remind her.</p>

<p>“I’ll match you for dollars,” said Jude. She was no
longer the person of a moment ago. She was the harbor
larrikin, the clodder of bathing nigger girls, a person to
be avoided by pious boys with possessions in the form
of money or land.</p>

<p>The coin spun in the air.</p>

<p>“Tails is the bird,” cried Jude.</p>

<p>“Heads, then.”</p>

<p>“Tails! Y’owe me a dollar.”</p>

<p>It spun again.</p>

<p>“Heads! We’re quits. Heads again, heads—oh, hell!—what
you want sticking to heads for? That’s two
dollars I owe you. Tails—scrumps! that’s three! Tails
again, that’s four. What you want sticking to tails
for? Why don’t you wabble about an’ give a body a
chance? Heads—holy Mike! What’s wrong with the
durned thing? Five dollars gone on a bang!”</p>

<p>“We’re not playing right,” said he. “We should call
alternately.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“One after the other.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to play any more,” said Jude. “I’m
broke. The bank’s bust and I kin’t pay you, not till I
get to Havana—unless I play you double or quits. You
call; I’ll toss.”</p>

<p>“Heads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
She sent the coin six feet high and it fell on the sand—heads!</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said Jude. “Ten dollars I owe you.
You’ll have to wait till we get to Havana, for if Satan
knew I was tossing for coins he’d sculp me. I can get
some money out of the bank at Havana, pretending it’s
for something else. I haven’t a cent, an’ this old dollar’s
no use: it’s a dud.”</p>

<p>“You don’t owe me anything,” said Ratcliffe. “We
were only tossing for fun.” The words were no sooner
out of his mouth than he regretted them.</p>

<p>Jude flushed red under her freckles and sunburn.</p>

<p>“I’m not taking your money, thank you,” said she;
then breaking out, “What the blizzard d’you think we’ve
been playing at, and what you take me for? S’posin’
I’d won, you’d a paid, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean anything,” said he.</p>

<p>“Y’shouldn’t have said it, then,” said she.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry—I take it back.”</p>

<p>She played with the dud dollar for a moment, tossing
it, and catching it; then she put it into her pocket, uncrossed
her legs, and lay flat; her chin resting on the
back of her hands.</p>

<p>Her hat was off, lying beside her, and the quarrel
with him was evidently over; she seemed plunged in
reverie. Then he noticed that the eyes, upturned under
their lashes, were steadfastly looking at him. Instantly
they fell, and her position altered so that her face was
hidden on her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
He lit his pipe and smoked for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“Jude!”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>Silence. He remembered how she had shammed dead
on Palm Island, put down his pipe, and crawled toward
the corpse. It was rigid, and to revive it he began to
pour sand on its head.</p>

<p>“Quit fooling,” grumbled a voice; then, as if the sand
had suddenly revived memory and galvanized her to life,
she scrambled to her feet.</p>

<p>“Them eggs—and the sun’s getting down and we fooling
about!” She picked up her hat. “I’ll take this end
and you go t’other.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t anything to gather them in.”</p>

<p>“Gather them in your hat, and keep a lookout for
quicksan’s. If you get into one, holler and throw yourself
on your back. But you’ll easy tell them—they look
different from the or’nary sands.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I dunno; just different. If you see the sand in front
of you looking different, keep clear of it.”</p>

<p>Off she went.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="subhead">DISHED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">He</span> struck to the north. Over there in the north the
sea was of a violet blue accentuated by the white
blaze of the sands.</p>

<p>The sands, once one got moving on them, were full
of interest, strewn along the sea-edge with all sorts of
prizes,—colored shells, cuttlefish bones, extraordinary
seaweeds, bits of wreckage; a few yards out a nautilus
fleet was steering, with tiny sails set to the wind, the
oldest ships that ever floated on the sea, unspoiled by
storm and time, just as they were launched in the morning
of the world. He watched them for awhile, forgetful
of gulls’ eggs, or quicksands, or the sun, now sensibly
declining.</p>

<p>If ever things had purpose, these had. They were
going somewhere, bound on some business, keeping formation,
and possessed of charts and compasses and
barometers as surely as of sails. They made him think
of God, and then they made him think of Satan,—Satan,
whose sea sense served him better than all precise knowledge.</p>

<p>Then he remembered Jude and glanced back. Away,
far away to the south, he saw her. The sands dipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and rose there, and sometimes she was invisible and his
heart thumped to the idea that a quicksand had taken
her, then she reappeared and he went on, and, ever as
he went, he seemed walking deeper into loneliness, peopled
with viewless things and half-heard voices.</p>

<p>Sometimes a chiming sound like the shattered and
mingled voices of distant bells filled the air,—it was the
singing of the sands. He had not noticed it in company
with Jude, but here alone he noticed it. Sometimes
laughter, far away in the distance, came distinct, human,
and startling,—it was the calling of a laughing gull,—and
always, penetrating all other sounds with the subtlety of
osmosis, the silky, sinister whisper of the wind playing
with the sand-grains. He went on. Something nearly
tripped him. It was a great spar, half sanded over, the
relic of some ship that had come to grief, maybe, on
the spit.</p>

<p>The sight of this spar touched everything with a new
and momentary color. “Gascoign, the Sandal Wood
Trader,” and other old stories he had read in his boyhood
came back to him half-remembered, and with them
came a whiff from a world he had half-forgotten,—a
breath of the air we breathe at fifteen.</p>

<p>He saw to his satisfaction that the gulls were beyond
his reach, a broad channel of water cutting the spit in
two right ahead. He took his seat on the spar for a
moment to rest and look about, and as he sat the gulls,
wheeling and crying, kept up around him the elusive
atmosphere of storyland.</p>

<p>All the money in the world could not have brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
him that! Nor could he have found it had he landed
here from a yacht with grown-up companions.</p>

<p>He fell to thinking what an extraordinarily lucky person
he was, and to plume himself on his instinctive wisdom
in dropping Skelton and civilization for Jude and
Satan, who had led him into a world of things he had
never seen, things he had never imagined, things he had
half-forgotten.</p>

<p>Carquinez alone was a revelation, to say nothing of
Sellers and Cleary. There was only one cloud, smaller
than a man’s hand; but there!—where was it to end?
It was all very well talking to Jude about sailing round
the world: you can’t sail out of Time, and the time would
come—the time would <span class="locked">come—</span></p>

<p>Jude was winding threads round him as a silkworm
winds a cocoon,—tiny threads but deathly strong. It
was almost as though she were becoming part of himself,—part
of himself and part the sun and freedom and
blue sea. She seemed half built up of those things and
to have the power to make him one with them. Well,
there was no use in bothering. So he said to himself,
and as he said it the cloud no larger than a man’s hand
swelled and twisted and rolled across the sandspit before
him, resolving itself into a troupe of female relations,
male relations, friends,—people as remote from Satan
and Jude as parrots from seagulls, caged parrots content
in the great gilded cage of convention.</p>

<p>What would they say about Jude? He had an instinctive
knowledge of what Jude would say about them, if
they ever met, which seemed impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Then came the weird recollection that they had, in a
way, actually met. She had met Skelton, the high priest
of the whole crowd, Sir William Skelton, Bart. Old
Popplecock was the label she had affixed to him, and it
somehow stuck and fitted. What label would she affix
to his aunts, his two maiden mid-Victorian aunts, should
she ever meet them?</p>

<p>A faint halloo from the south sent aunts and all other
considerations flying. He turned. Jude, far away on
the sands, was coming toward the dinghy. She was
carrying something and running as if pursued; then he
saw her trip and fall.</p>

<p>She was on her feet in a second, and the thing pursuing
her had evidently given up the hunt, for she stood
examining something she had picked up from the ground,
and seemed regardless of everything else.</p>

<p>He waited for her by the boat, and as she came up
he guessed the tragedy. She had been carrying a hatful
of birds’ eggs and had smashed than when she fell.
The hat was eloquent.</p>

<p>“Smashed them every one,” said Jude, wading out and
beginning to wash the hat. “All your fault!”</p>

<p>“My fault! For heaven’s sake how?”</p>

<p>“Stuffing me up with them yarns.”</p>

<p>“What yarns?”</p>

<p>“Hants.”</p>

<p>“Was that what made you run?”</p>

<p>“Who was running?”</p>

<p>“You were.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was I? Reckon you’d have run too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
“Did you see anything?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“You never mind.”</p>

<p>She was evidently in a vile, bad temper; so he took
his seat on the sand waiting for her to cool. Then, hat
in hand, she came and sat close beside him, more out
of a desire for company than friendship, he imagined;
then, placing the hat to dry, she began examining the
sole of her right foot, spreading the toes apart and
brushing off the sand.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m awfully sorry,” said he at length. “But
tell us—what was it you saw, really?”</p>

<p>“A wuzzard.”</p>

<p>“What was it like?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” then suddenly, and as if unburdening her
soul, “I hadn’t more’n got the last of the eggs when I
turned and saw him walking on the sands,—little old
man with a glass under his arm, dressed queer in a long
coat, an’ a hat on his head like an I dunno what. I
wasn’t afraid, thought he was real, and he stuck the
glass to his eye ’sif he was looking out for a ship.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then he went out—puff—like the sniff of a candle—hu—hu—”
She clung to him.</p>

<p>“It was all my fault,” said he, “talking that nonsense.
Don’t think of it: it was only an optical illusion.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t cast a shadow—I remember now.”</p>

<p>“That proves it. I’ve often heard cases like that.
Sir Walter Scott saw a man like that once, and he knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
it was only an illusion. He had some wine handy and
he drank a glass of it, and the thing disappeared.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’d have drunk a barrel of rum if I’d had
one handy,” said Jude, drawing away a bit. “Let’s get
off. Lord! Look at the sun—it’s half down. Come’n
help with the boat.”</p>

<p>They got up, and taking the dinghy by the gunnels
began to haul her to the water. They had not got her
more than a couple of yards when Jude straightened up
as though remembering something and clapped her hand
to her head.</p>

<p>“We’re dished!” said Jude.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CRABS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“How</span> do you mean?” said he.</p>

<p>She explained. It was like her to forget and
spend the precious time lazing and playing about with
“wuzzards.” The sun was taking his plunge into the
sea, darkness was upon them, and she could not find her
way back in the dark. Moon or starlight would be of
no use. The thriddy spars of the <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Juan</i>, invisible
from the sandspit even in daylight, would be picked
up only several miles out. She could not steer by the
stars, and there was a great sweep of current setting
sou’east which might take them to Timbuktu. Satan
would have done the business right enough blindfolded;
but she was a night-funk, she confessed it. Night put
her all abroad and mixed up everything in her mind so
that front seemed back and west seemed east, besides
filling the world with “hants.” She had “near died” of
fright fetching that sack from the cache the other night.</p>

<p>All this in a lugubrious voice not far from tears, as
they stood facing each other, and lit by the remorselessly
setting sun.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Ratcliffe. “Cheer up. We’ll just
have to stick here till daybreak. We have some grub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
left and lots of water. No use pulling the boat farther
down. But I expect Satan will be in a stew.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he’ll know,” said Jude. “The weather’s all
right. He’d scent if we were in any trouble, and he’d
borrow Cark’s boat to hunt for us.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean ’scent’?”</p>

<p>“He’d smell trouble; he’s awful sharp.”</p>

<p>“Sort of telepathy.”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“Mind reading.”</p>

<p>“I dunno, but I reckon he’s not worrying, and if he
was he’d be alongside here pronto.”</p>

<p>Her face was like a buttercup in the extraordinary
light of that sunset. The whole sky was buttercup
color; the great sea was seething round the great sun,
now half-gone, churning and washing round him, a blazing
globe sinking in boiling gold.</p>

<p>Golden gulls, golden sky, golden sea,—all fading at
last, the purple of night breaking through, rushing dark
from the west across the sea.</p>

<p>The shipwrecked mariners lost their golden faces and
hands, and, as they sat down with their backs to the
dinghy and the remains of the “grub” between them,
laughing gulls, passing like ghosts in the twilight, hailed
them, while the stars broke out to look above the darkness
and the tepid wind.</p>

<p>There is nothing like eating to keep up the spirits.
Jude got less doleful. In the stir of mind caused by the
new circumstances she had clean forgotten the “hants,”
nor did she remember them for a moment now, as she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
chatted away in an uplift of spirits caused by the food
and the recognition that to be downcast was futile.</p>

<p>“I sure am a mutt!” said Jude. “Reckon I was born
on a Friday—they say mugs are all born on a Friday.
We should a been off two hours before sundown, and
there I was talking and listening to your yarns, and
here we are on the beach—oh, mommer!” Then after
a long pause:</p>

<p>“What’s them stars, do you reckon?”</p>

<p>“Suns.”</p>

<p>“Gar’n!”</p>

<p>“It’s so.”</p>

<p>“Say!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice anything looking north before sundown,
or were you asleep sitting on that spar?”</p>

<p>“I did see something over there; looked like the ghost
of a cloud.”</p>

<p>“That was Rum Cay, and a sure sign the weather’s
going to hold. It lifts itself into the sky like that, evening
times; you can see it from Lone Reef too.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had known that and I should have looked
at it more particularly. I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“What was you thinking about?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “My people.”</p>

<p>“Which people?”</p>

<p>“My relations.”</p>

<p>“What made you think of them for?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
“Yes, I was wondering what you’d think of them if
you saw them, especially my aunts.”</p>

<p>“Well, you take the bun,” said Jude, “you sitting there
thinking of your aunts and me running with them eggs!”
She stopped of a sudden; her memory had suddenly conjured
up the “wuzzard.”</p>

<p>“That cuss!” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“The one I saw.” She wriggled close to him till their
sides touched. “S’posin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“S’posin’ he was to take it into his head to do a walk
along here?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother about him,” said Ratcliffe. “I’d
kick him into the sea—besides, he was only an optical
illusion. It was my stupid talk did it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not bothering,” said Jude, “only it’s a durned
long time till morning. N’matter,” she rested her hand
on his shoulder in all the familiarity of companionship;
then she shifted her hand from his left to his right
shoulder so that her arm was across his back, and then
she fell silent and he felt something poking into his left
shoulder—it was her nose! She had evidently under his
protection forgotten “hants” and “wuzzards,” forgotten
him, even, for she was humming a sort of tune under
her breath.</p>

<p>He knew exactly her mental condition,—mind wandering,—and
it was a strange feeling to be cuddled like
that by a person who had half-forgotten his existence,
except as a protection against fears, especially when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
remembered her recent antagonism that had developed so
mysteriously and as mysteriously vanished. He slipped
his left arm round her to make her more comfortable.
Then her nose gave place to her cheek against his shoulder
and she yawned. He could feel her ribs under her
guernsey and the beat of her heart just beneath the gentle
swell of her breast. He remembered her coat, which
was in the dinghy. She had thrown it in as an after-thought
in case of a change of weather, but had never
worn it.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better put on your coat?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Lord! I don’t want no coat.”</p>

<p>“But the night air.”</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong with it. It’s a Gulf wind an’ as hot
as a blanket—ain’t you warm enough?”</p>

<p>“Lots.”</p>

<p>“Ever slept out before?”</p>

<p>“Only in a tent—have you?”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“Slept out before?”</p>

<p>“Heaps o’ times. But I wouldn’t sleep out in a full
moon.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I don’t want to wake up with my face twisted
to one side like a flat fish—mean to say you don’t know?—either
that or a chap goes loony. But there’s no fear
tonight; it’s only a half-moon. The only thing I’m
frightened of is crabs. We’ve gotta keep our eyes
skinned for crabs. This mayn’t be a crab spit; then
again, there’s no knowing but it may.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
“What on earth is a crab spit?”</p>

<p>Jude raised her face from his shoulder and sat up a
bit straighter as though the question had roused her.</p>

<p>“Place where crabs come, hun’erds of millions of them,
same as Crab Cay. There’s crabs everywhere of course,
but not in shiploads same as Crab Cay. Three men
were drifted ashore there once, and after sundown up
came the crabs and fought them all night, and there was
nothing but their skeletons left in the morning. We’d
better take it turn about to keep watch.”</p>

<p>She released herself from his arm and scrambling about
in the starlight on her hands and knees began to make
a sand pillow.</p>

<p>“There you are!” said she. “Stick your head on it;
I’ll take first watch. You be port watch, and I’ll be
sta’board.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t! I will. I’m not a bit sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Neither’m I. Stick your head on it. You’ve gotta
turn in or you’ll be no use tomorrow.”</p>

<p>He did as he was bid, and Jude took her place sitting
on the sand close to him.</p>

<p>“Give us a call if anything happens,” said he.</p>

<p>“You bet!” replied Jude.</p>

<p>Then he closed his eyes. A moment before and he
had been leagues away from sleep, but with the compulsory
closing of his eyes a drowsiness began to steal on
him. The wind had died to nothing and in the dead
silence of the night the sound of the waves on the mile
and a half of spit came loud and low, rhythmical, mesmeric.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
It was as though the tide of sleep were rising
to drift him off.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly, he was walking in the blazing sunlight
on the spit, and toward him was walking the “wuzzard,”—a
little old man in a cocked hat with a spyglass
under his arm, who vanished, giving place to Jude,
carrying a hatful of gulls’ eggs.</p>

<p>Then Skelton landed from somewhere, and Jude,
turning, was calling him a “pesky brute.”</p>

<p>The words broke the dream, and he opened his eyes.
The moon had just risen, touching the spit, and in her
light, seated on the sand propped up on its stilts, a
spirit crab, white as snow with ruby eyes, was staring
at Jude.</p>

<p>Drugged with weariness and ozone, he closed his eyes
for one moment, determined to rise up and drive the
thing away in one moment. When he opened his eyes
again the sun was rising.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RETURN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> gulls were mewing and calling and flying above
him in the blue. He was lying on his back, his left
arm out, and Jude’s head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>She had snuggled up beside him for company, and
then, regardless of spirit crabs, “hants,” and the possibility
of crustaceans landing in shiploads to devour
them, had fallen asleep. Her arm was flung over his
chest. It was the embrace of a tired child, delightful
to wake up to as the freshness of the air and the new
life of the world and the innocence of the flower-blue
sky, delightful as her breath, sweet and warm against
his cheek. As he moved she stirred, grumbled something
under her breath, shifted her head so that his arm
was released, and turned on her other side, with her
right arm flung out on the sand.</p>

<p>He stood up. The tide was in and the dinghy only
waiting to be launched. Not a sail or speck upon the
sea.</p>

<p>Rum Cay had prophesied right,—the fine weather
held,—but the water was nearly gone, and the “grub”
was finished. There was no breakfast till they boarded
the <i>Sarah</i> again.</p>

He turned to where the starboard watch was lying,
clinging still to Morpheus, and stirred it gently with his
foot. Jude moved, turned, grumbled to herself, and
then, as if electrified, sat up digging her fists into her
eyes and yawning. Then she sat gazing at the sea as if
stunned.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Ratcliffe, “we’ve got to be starting.
All the grub’s gone and nearly all the water. How did
you sleep?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” said Jude. “I’ve been chasin’ round the
hull night with a hatful of eggs. I’m near dead beat.
Which way’s the wind? Sou’east. Must a changed in
the night. It’ll take us back in two ticks.”</p>

<p>She collapsed again comfortably.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said he, “the current is against us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it ain’t no distance,” said Jude, “and a few minutes
more or less don’t count. Wonder what Satan’s
doing?”</p>

<p>Knowing that it was hopeless to bother till the spirit
moved her, he sat down on the sand beside her and
began picking up little shells and casting them into the
sea.</p>

<p>“Goodness knows!” said he. “I’m wondering what
he’ll say when we get back.”</p>

<p>“He’ll start jawing,” said Jude dreamily and fatefully
and with her eyes closed. “I can hear him as if I was
listening. He’ll say, ‘What you mean leaving the ship,
and where’s your eggs?’ No use telling him they’re
broke. Lord! I’m sick of it all! I’m just going to
lay here and die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
He began to drop shells on her chest.</p>

<p>“Quit foolin’.”</p>

<p>“Then get up and come on. Let’s get it over. It’s
like having a tooth pulled,—the sooner over the better.”</p>

<p>“Did y’ever have a tooth pulled?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What’s it like?”</p>

<p>“Beastly for a moment, but it’s soon over.”</p>

<p>“Did y’spit blood?”</p>

<p>“Rather! Come on.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming in a minute.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly she sat up, put on her hat, scrambled
to her feet, took a glance round the sea, and made for
the dinghy.</p>

<p>“Shove in the water jar,” said Jude. He put the jar
in, seized the opposite gunnel, and ran her down.</p>

<p>In a minute they were afloat, the sail spread to the
wind, Jude steering and holding the sheet. Gulls chased
them out, and the beam wind meeting tide and current
sent boosts of spray on board. It was a rougher passage
coming than going, and a more silent one. Ratcliffe,
squatting in the bottom of the boat, had little else
to do than smoke and watch Jude. Jude, engaged with
her own thoughts, and with her eyes keened for the
indications of Lone Reef, seemed absolutely to have forgotten
him.</p>

<p>There was no indication of the companion who had
slept with her arm round him, who had sat almost
lovingly, half-forgetfully, with her arm across his shoulder
and his arm round her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
It came to him suddenly and with a curious pang that
Jude would never be more than that,—a warm companion
if cast alone together, just as she might be with
Satan, or any stranger her fancy approved of.</p>

<p>Instinctively he felt that there was a barrier,—a curious
barrier, he seemed to have broken through that
night he took her part, and when, for the first time in
her life, she had confessed herself at fault; a barrier,
that had, however, mended itself. It was as though
he had injured her independence. Yet Satan was injuring
her independence all day long with his orders and
what not. Ay, but Satan was her brother, almost part
of herself. She would not have banged Satan on the
head for kissing her.</p>

<p>He gave up thinking, watching her and how well she
handled the boat. The crying of the gulls round the
spit had died down; nothing remained but the voice of
the sea, silent as dumb death from the blue horizon to
the planking of the dinghy when it spoke.</p>

<p>“That’s her!” suddenly said Jude.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Lone—I kin see the spars of the <i>Juan</i> an’ the <i>Sarah</i>.
Rubber and you’ll see them too.”</p>

<p>He turned with his elbow resting on the thwart and
picked out the spars on the sea-line.</p>

<p>“And the <i>Natchez</i>,” said Jude. “Look, close up to
the <i>Juan</i>. Cleary’s put in and we not there! I’d forgot
Cleary; didn’t believe he’d pick up the place so soon.
There he is. Oh, hell!”</p>

<p>“No matter,” said Ratcliffe; “it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
“Cuss them gulls! If they’d stuck to their laying
places, we’d have got the eggs soon’s we’d landed and
been back last night. Wonder what’s been going on?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “Satan’s all right. Cleary has no
grudge against him. If there has been any bother, it
has been between Cleary and Sellers.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Jude.</p>

<p>An hour later they were so close up that they could
see the reef-line and the line of the wreck with fellows
working on it. Whatever had happened, business was
going on as usual.</p>

<p>The three vessels, anchored and swinging to the tide,
looked peaceful enough, and as they drew up to the
<i>Sarah</i>, Satan, who had just appeared on deck, came and
stood by the starboard rail watching them.</p>

<p>They fastened up, preparing for an explosion. None
came.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t get back last night,” said Jude as they came
on board. “Left it till sundown, and then I was afeard
of the current.”</p>

<p>“Afeard of the dark,” said Satan. “I reckoned that’d
be so—whar’s your eggs?”</p>

<p>“Gone phut. Smashed the lot. Wasn’t more than a
hatful. Them rotten gulls had given up nesting, all but
at the ends—and say, Satan, I saw a wuzzard! I was
carrying the eggs when I saw him, and then I ran and
smashed the lot.”</p>

<p>“A which?”</p>

<p>“A hant—little old chap walking on the sands. D’you
remember the figurehead on that old bark they broke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
up last year at Havana,—man with a glass under his
arm and the other arm wavin’ his hat? That was him
plain as my eye. He up with his glass and I let one
yelp. Rat’ll tell you: he saw me running.”</p>

<p>“Oh, git along—git along, you and your hants! I’d
been countin’ on them eggs, and here you come back like
a one-eyed skite with your yarns about hants. Why,
you ought a had a boatful! Didn’t you see no turkles’
eggs?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Well, come along down if you want some grub. I
sighted you more’n an hour ago, and there’s coffee
waitin’. D’ye see that?” He pointed to a new-washed
jumper drying in the blazing sun on the rail.</p>

<p>“Well, I was het up,” said Jude, “or I’d have la’ndered
it before I started.”</p>

<p>“Come along down,” said Satan.</p>

<p>It came to Ratcliffe that the quietude of Satan over
the business came less from natural good temper than
some other reason. The desertion of the <i>Sarah</i> was
mutiny and a rank crime. Satan had been left with his
food to cook and his jumper to wash, his sister had been
off with an almost stranger for a whole night—yet he
was not displeased.</p>

<p>If Jude had done the business alone, she most surely
would have been carpeted. It was evidently his—Ratcliffe’s—participation
in it that fended off trouble and
turned wrath into complacence. Why?</p>

<p>Was it because he was a guest? Not a bit! Satan,
had he been angry, would not have bothered about that.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
He followed down below, and there, over the breakfast
table, the Cleary business was cleared up.</p>

<p>“He dropped in last night,” said Satan, “an hour before
sundown, and the anchor hadn’t more than clawed the
mud before he was aboard the <i>Juan</i>. I expected the
shootin’ to begin; but there weren’t no fireworks, and
after dark I lit out for the <i>Juan</i> in the c’lapsible and tied
up and boarded her. All the men were in the foc’sle,
eating onions and playin’ tunes on guitars,—no anchor
watch,—and the Cleary crowd down in the saloon as
friendly as pie, Cark ladling the liquor and Cleary suckin’
it down, cigars as big as your leg in their faces, and
Cleary with his thumbs in the armhulls of his vest
leanin’ back laughin’. That’s how I found them.”</p>

<p>“I told you,” said Jude to Ratcliffe, “they’d be kissing
each other and—”</p>

<p>“Suppose you shet your head!” said Satan. “I’m
tellin’ you—there they were sittin’ all colludin’ together
thick as thick, and I sat for an hour with them and then
lit out. Sweet as sugar they were; but I tell you this,
I’m as frightened as hell.”</p>

<p>“How’s thet?”</p>

<p>“Cleary. Y’see Cark and Sellers aren’t much by themselves,
but Cleary is the snake’s tooth an’ poison bug of
that combination, now that he’s joined in with Cark
again. Cleary’s Irish gone bad on the father’s side and
drunk Welsh on the mother’s: I had his pedigree from
Pap. Pap said he was a sure-enough thoroughbred of
a hellhound, and he reckoned the roof of his mouth was
black right down to the heart of him. Well, I’ve had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
forty dollars from Cleary for them rotten pearls and one
thousand dollars from Cark on account of takin’s. Now
you see how I am, supposin’ the wreck turns out a dud.
D’you mean to say they won’t go for me to get their
money back? Supposin’ the gold is there. D’you mean
to say they won’t chouse me out of my share?”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I worked the hull thing out last night before I boarded
them. Seeing there was no fighting, I concluded they’d
joined up an’ become friends; then I made my plans, I
didn’t put out no anchor light.</p>

<p>“Sellers, when I was leaving the <i>Juan</i>, said, ‘Whar’s
your light?’</p>

<p>“‘Run short of oil,’ says I. ‘Kin you let me have
some?’ He thought I was tryin’ to wangle oil out of
him, and he closed; said he was run short himself.”</p>

<p>“What was your meaning in not putting out a light?”
asked Jude.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll find out,” said Satan, “if you keep your
eyes skinned and stop askin’ questions. Well, that’s
where we are. They’ll have the barrel of gunpowder
fixed by tomorrow to blow the deck off her, and as soon
as they put a light to it we’ll know. It’s blastin’ powder
and ought to split the deck to flinders if they fix it
proper. I don’t b’lieve it’s coral coverin’ that deck, I
b’lieve it’s old petrifacted guano, if you ask me; anyhow,
it’s hard enough.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said Ratcliffe. “If that’s so, it bears out
my theory. I came to the conclusion that the old hooker
had never been under water according to that yarn Lopez<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
slung; yet I couldn’t account for the coral deposits. I
believe you’re right. I believe the real wreck is lying
at that place you said that’s given in the latitude and
longitude. Well, see here, why not get the anchor up
and light out right now for the other place. They
wouldn’t follow.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they?” said Satan. “The <i>Natchez</i> would be
after us like a cat pouncin’. No, I’d rather stick, if it’s
all the same to you, and see the fireworks. After that
leave ’em to me. There aren’t many’s got the better of
me when my dander’s up. Now then, Jude, if you’ve
done stuffin’ yourself, maybe you’ll lend a hand on deck.
There’s swabbin’ to be done.”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="subhead">A BOTTLE OF RUM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Ratcliffe</span> helped in the swabbing and polishing.
No housekeeper ever exercised more meticulous
care in this respect than Satan. He was a fanatic where
cleanliness was concerned, and polish,—witness the
brasswork of the wheel, the binnacle and skylight,—even
paint and varnish were minor gods compared with
Brasso!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the Sarahites worked, the <i>Natchez</i> and
<i>Juan</i>, lying in cynical and sinister neglect and dirt, showed
little signs of life. The working party on the reef
seemed busy enough; but the ships, save for a few hands
lounging at the rails or squatting about the foc’sle head,
might have been deserted.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock a boat put off from the <i>Natchez</i>.
Cleary was in the sternsheets, and as she came alongside
he hailed the <i>Sarah</i>.</p>

<p>Satan came to the rail.</p>

<p>“Sellers’s going to bust her open today,” said Cleary.
“Just had word from him.”</p>

<p>“I thought he wouldn’t be ready till tomorrow,” said
Satan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
“Just had word the hole’s near deep enough and the
star cuttin’s from it. He’s got the powder off and reckons
to fire it at noon. Wants you to come an’ help.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does he?”</p>

<p>“He’s a bit bothered about the fuse, not havin’ done
much of that sort of work, and he reckons you’re an
ingenious cuss an’ll be able to put him wise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does he? Well, I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>Cleary came over the rail.</p>

<p>“No spittin’!” cried Satan.</p>

<p>Cleary, averting his head in time to send the squirt
of tobacco juice overside instead of on the deck, looked
around.</p>

<p>He nodded at Ratcliffe, disregarded Jude, and fixed
his eye on the blazing binnacle and the glittering rods of
the skylight.</p>

<p>“Dandy ship,” said he. “Whaar you goin’ to take the
prize?”</p>

<p>“Where your old tub’d be skeered to show her nose.
How’s the potato crop gettin’ along?”</p>

<p>Cleary turned his quid over and allowed his eyes to
travel about the deck.</p>

<p>“Waal,” said he, speaking with point and consideration,
“some likes one thing and some likes another, but
I never did see that fandanglin’ with frills an’ brasswork
an’ sich lends anythin’ to the <em>sailin’</em> qualities of a ship.”</p>

<p>Jude, raising herself up from flemish coiling a rope,
blazed out:</p>

<p>“Maybe it don’t to an old cod boat blowin’ along with
her own smell,” began Jude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
“Shet up!” said Satan. Then to Cleary, “Have a
drink?”</p>

<p>“I’m willin’,” said Cleary, “but thought you was a dry
ship.”</p>

<p>Satan winked, slipped below, and returned with a bottle
of rum, a glass, and a water jar. There were three
or four bottles of rum on board. Satan said he kept
the stuff for “rubbing his corns”; he never drank it.
There were also a revolver and a rifle on board. He
never fired them: lethal weapons have their time and
place.</p>

<p>Satan, having placed the bottle and jar on the deck,
produced another glass from his pocket, filled out a four-finger
peg for Cleary and another for himself.</p>

<p>“Here’s luck,” said Cleary.</p>

<p>“Here’s luck—no <em>spittin’</em>!”</p>

<p>They drained glasses.</p>

<p>“Holy Mike!” cried Cleary, his eyes bulging and his
face injected. “What sorter bug-water’s this?”</p>

<p>“British Navy; thirty over proof.”</p>

<p>Cleary, with one eye shut, seemed turning over in his
mind the activities going on in his stomach and on the
whole approving.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “I’ve drunk wasp brandy and one or
two nigger dopes—they don’t get near it, not in knots. A
man’d want to be a centipede to carry a bottle of that
stuff, I reckon. N’more, thanky. Well, I’m off, and
I’ll fly a flag when Cark gives the signal he’s got the stuff
ready for the fuse.”</p>

<p>Off he went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
“For the land’s sake, Satan! what made you swallow
that stuff for?” said Jude.</p>

<p>Satan took his seat on the skylight edge, then he gulped,
then he hiccupped.</p>

<p>“Get your hind legs under you and cart the bottle and
the glasses down below,” said Satan. “Strewth!—gimme
the water jar till I flood my hold.”</p>

<p>He drank till Ratcliffe thought he would never stop,
then he went to the port rail and canceled matters.</p>

<p>“It’s Demerara Black John,” said he apologetically to
Ratcliffe as he turned, wiping his mouth with the back of
his hand. “Some likes it, but I’ve no holdin’ with drink.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe was about to ask why he had swallowed it,
but he checked himself. Jude, who had just appeared
again, put the question.</p>

<p>“What in the nation made you drink that snake-juice?”
asked Jude.</p>

<p>Satan took a glance at the sun, at the reef, and at the
<i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said he, “finish up clarin’ away that raffle
and get the dinner ready; I’ve no time to be talkin’.”</p>

<p>He set to sand and canvassing the rail he had been
working on when Cleary appeared, Jude and Ratcliffe
took up their jobs, and the ordinary life of the <i>Sarah</i> resumed
as though the rum incident had never been.</p>

<p>All the same, work could not prevent Ratcliffe from
pondering the dark problem of Satan and his doings.</p>

<p>Why had he not put out an anchor light last night?
Why had he pretended to Sellers that he was short of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
oil? Why had he swallowed a glass of rum only to unswallow
it again?</p>

<p>Then in the monotony of work his mind passed from
these considerations to a state of pleasant expectancy.
What would they find in the wreck, and the explosion of
the barrel of powder, how would it come off?</p>

<p>He felt as pleased as a boy about to fire a brass cannon
and not sure whether it will burst or not.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="subhead">THEY FIRE THE FUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Satan</span> used a modification of the deck bear for cleaning
his decks; that is to say, a box filled with stones
having a rough mat nailed under it. The deck having
been sprinkled with sand, the bear had to be pulled backward
and forward after the fashion of a carpet sweeper.
This was Ratcliffe’s job, and he was not sorry when it
was over.</p>

<p>Dinner was served at eight bells, and getting along
toward one o’clock the <i>Natchez</i> and <i>Juan</i> were flying all
sorts of flags on the tepid breeze as a signal, evidently,
that it was time to get to business.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe made out the red and white flag indicating H,
the triangular blue with the white ball, the red cross on
a white ground, and the white with the blue square,—H.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;S.</p>

<p>“What are they trying to say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, them flags,” replied Satan. “<em>They’re</em> not tryin’
to say anythin’, only flyin’ to show time’s up. Cark
hasn’t got a full set of the c’mercial code; wouldn’t know
how to use them, neither. Now if you’re ready we’ll put
off. Jude will stick here to keep ship.”</p>

<p>Jude protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
“Why, you’ll see the blow-up from here a durned sight
better than from the boat,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“I want to see her innards when the deck’s off,” said
Jude.</p>

<p>“Why, Lord bless me! you’ll have days to see them
in,” said Satan, “and there’s no knowin’ what may happen
when the blow-up comes, what with flyin’ timbers
and muck. I’ll come back and bring you off when the
powder’s fired. I can’t say fairer than that.”</p>

<p>They got into the dinghy and shoved off, Jude watching
them.</p>

<p>Sellers was waiting for them on the reef, and Cleary.
Their boats were on the strip of beach surrounded by the
crews, and a couple of fellows on the wreck were putting
the last touches to the preparation of the charge. Sellers
was holding what seemed a length of thick white cord in
his hand.</p>

<p>“Here’s the fuse,” said he. “I had it left over with the
barrel from that last wrecking business we did in the fall.
It’s a five-minutes’ fuse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it?” said Satan, handling the thing. “And
where’s your guarantee? S’posin’ it only takes a minute?
And five minutes is none too much for the man that fires
it to get clear of the reef and put out.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Sellers, “and one of you will have
to do the firin’ business, seein’ I’m lame.”</p>

<p>“What’s lamed you?”</p>

<p>“Fell on the deck this mornin’ over a slush tub one of
them damn dagoes left lyin’ in the dark. Near put my
knee out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
“Then Cleary will do the trick,” said Satan.</p>

<p>Cleary laughed. “Not me! I’m not lame, but it ain’t
my job. Runnin’ over rocks don’t suit me, and I reckon
the man that lays a light to that thing will want to be
a boundin’ kangaroo.”</p>

<p>“Instead of a damned ass like y’self,” said Satan.
“Come on. I’ll light it, I’m not afeard.”</p>

<p>They clambered over the rocks, crossed the rock bridge,
and gained the wreck.</p>

<p>The little barrel had been well and truly laid, the top
almost flush with the level of the stuff covering the deck.</p>

<p>“We got right through the deck plankin’,” said Sellers,
“or to a crossbeam. Wood’s most dry-rotted, and it’ll
be a nacheral mercy if the powder don’t blow the whole
coffee shop to blazes right down to the reef. Here’s the
hole for the fuse.”</p>

<p>While they were examining the fuse-hole, Ratcliffe took
notice of the cuts radiating starlike from the charge-hole
that had been made in the deck-casing. When he turned
again, Satan, with the aid of Sellers, had fixed the fuse.
The Spanish sailors who had been at work had taken their
departure and were already down by the boats, leaving
only four men on the wreck,—Satan, Sellers, Cleary and
himself.</p>

<p>Satan rose up, clapped the knees of his trousers as if
to knock dust off them, and produced a yellow box of
Swedish matches from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Ratcliffe. “It’s not fair. Let’s
draw lots who’ll fire the thing.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said Satan. “I wouldn’t trust one of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
two with a box of matches, let alone a dollar. Now then,
scatter for the boats!”</p>

<p>Then to Ratcliffe, as Sellers and Cleary made off,
“Stand by ready to shove the dinghy off when you see
me coming.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the other; “but I’ll stick by you if you
like.”</p>

<p>“I reckon two don’t run quicker than one,” said Satan.
“Off with you, and, if I’m blown to blazes, look after
the kid.”</p>

<p>When Ratcliffe reached the strip of beach the boats
of the <i>Juan</i> and <i>Natchez</i> had shoved off. He could see
the figure of Carquinez at the after-rail of the <i>Juan</i> and
Jude watching from the <i>Sarah</i>. He pulled the dinghy
down a bit more to the water and then, turning, looked
at the wreck.</p>

<p>Satan was standing against the skyline, now he was
down on his knees, and now he was up again. The fuse
had evidently been fired, but he did not move; stood evidently
looking to see that it was burning properly, and
then moved off, walking, not running, and not even hurrying
himself.</p>

<p>Then he came clambering over the rocks, reached the
dinghy, and they pushed off.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a cool chap,” said Ratcliffe. “I’d have
run.”</p>

<p>“And broke your leg, maybe. There’s no danger unless
a spark got at the powder. The durned thing was
sparkin’ and spittin’ like all possessed when I left it.
I reckon that’s why Sellers got cold feet. We’re out far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
enough now.” He ceased rowing, and they hung drifting.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe looked round. The other boats were much
farther out. The tepid wind had almost died off, so that
the flags on the <i>Juan</i> and <i>Natchez</i> hung in wisps. They
could hear the wash of the water on the reef and the occasional
lamentation of a gull. No other sound broke
the silence of the blue and gorgeous afternoon.</p>

<p>“Seems like as if everything was listenin’, don’t it?”
said Satan, wiping his forehead. “The bust ought to
have come by this. Wonder if the durned thing has
fizzled out?”</p>

<p>A gull made derisive answer and across the satin
smooth swell a hail came from the <i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s Cark,” said Satan, “makin’ kind inquiries,
blister him!”</p>

<p>“There she goes!” cried Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>A jet of flame and a column of smoke sprang from the
reef, followed by a clap of thunder that could have been
heard at Rum Cay.</p>

<p>Flying filth and deck planking filled the air, and on top
of all came the yelling of a thousand gulls.</p>

<p>The dinghy jumped as though from the blow of a
great fist—then silence, and over the reef a filthy dun-colored
cloud of smoke curling upward like a djin.</p>

<p>Satan seized the sculls and headed for the beach. The
boats of the <i>Juan</i> and <i>Natchez</i>, already under way, were
rowing as if for a wager, but the dinghy had the lead.
They beached her, hauled her up a foot, and started over
the rocks, running this time, heedless of broken limbs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Satan leading like the bounding kangaroo of Cleary’s and
whooping as he went.</p>

<p>The rock bridge was still intact, but nearly the whole
of the after part of the deck was gone.</p>

<p>“Go careful!” cried Satan. He got down on hands and
knees and, crawling, followed by Ratcliffe, leaned over
the break and looked.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe cried out in horror.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CARGO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> that vast and gloomy interior the great beams
showed like the ribs of some eviscerated monster and
the honest light of day fell sick upon the cargo,—a cargo
of skulls, ribs, vertebræ, and entire skeletons, piled high,
as though five hundred men had struggled aft for exit in
one mad rush and died heaped one upon the other like
refuse. A charnel, limy smell rose, poisoning the air.</p>

<p>“Good God!” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Slaver,” said Satan. “What did I tell you? <i>Nombre
de Dios</i> be sugared! She’s an old slaver, wrecked with
the men under hatches. Here’s Sellers!”</p>

<p>Sellers, panting, his face all mottled, and followed by
Cleary, had gained the deck.</p>

<p>“Boys, what is it?” cried Sellers.</p>

<p>“Gold!” cried Satan. “Go careful, for the hull deck’s
sprung. Get on your hands and knees. Gold bars an’
di’monds—we’re all rich men!”</p>

<p>The pair of scoundrels, crawling like crabs, stuck their
heads over the break.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Slaver,” said Satan.</p>

<p>Cleary spat. He was the first to laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
“This is putting it over on Cark, ain’t it?” said Cleary.
“How many dollars d’you think it’s cost our firm to blow
the lid off this damned scrofagus, to say nothin’ of the
time? And he packed me off to Pensacola to get me out
of the way! Oh, send for him to have a look!”</p>

<p>“No use sendin’, he’s comin’,” said Satan, pointing to
where the gig of the <i>Juan</i> was approaching the beach.</p>

<p>Carquinez crossed the rock-bridge and advanced along
the deck, clutching his old coat together and making birdlike
noises. When he reached the break, crouching like
the others, he looked over.</p>

<p>The sight below did not seem to horrify him.</p>

<p>“Slaver,” said Satan for the third time, turning his
head for a moment from the objects that seemed to
fascinate him.</p>

<p>“Pst, pst, pst!” said Carquinez. “Vel, I reckon dat is
so.”</p>

<p>“No gold ship,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Maybe there was gold in the after-cabin,” suddenly
broke in Cleary, “and the niggers broke through the bulkhead
and are on top of it.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your bulkheads?” asked Sellers. “There was
no after-cabin to the hooker. It was all one cattle boat
below, with niggers for cattle.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Carquinez.</p>

<p>The old gentleman seemed taking his setback extraordinarily
well; so, too, seemed Sellers and Cleary. They
were evidently used to reverses in business, and treasure
hunting was wildcat anyway, a thousand to one against
the chance of a colossal fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
“That is so,” said Carquinez. Then he proceeded to
demonstrate what the hold of a slaver was like,—men
lying side by side and sometimes on top of one another.
There was no after-cabin, indeed nothing, no latrines,
no means of washing, nothing: just one vast sty without
straw even for the human beasts to lie on.</p>

<p>The officers and crew slept in deckhouses; sometimes
the crew had nothing to shelter them, sleeping on the bare
decks.</p>

<p>Carquinez knew it all. His grandfather had been in
the business, and he mentioned the fact with a sort of
pride.</p>

<p>Then he drew back from the break like a reptile
balked and retreating; rose to his feet, and stood contemplating
the sea.</p>

<p>Satan rose also, as did Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“I’m off,” said Satan. “This boneyard don’t please me
any. Say, what you goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“Von moment,” said Cark.</p>

<p>“Which?” asked Satan.</p>

<p>“Cark means how about the contrac’?” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Lord! Why, we’re left, left with a cargo of skelentons,
and you—why, you’ve got a thousand dollars in your
pocket.”</p>

<p>“There was nothin’ in the contrac’ about handin’ them
back,” said Satan; “b’sides the contrac’s bust. That
thousand dollars was on account of findin’s. Is it my
fault the findin’s is skelentons? But, see here, you give’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
a few hours to turn the thing over, and come aboard the
<i>Sarah</i> gettin’ along sundown, and we’ll have a clack.
We’re all in the soup, seems to me, and I’m not wishin’
to be hard on you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll drop aboard,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>Cleary said nothing.</p>

<p>After his outburst of laughter he had remained dumb.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off,” said Satan. “I want a drink and
that’s the truth. The smell of them skelentons’s enough
to start a Baptis’ minister on the booze.” Then he turned
to Carquinez. “What did I tell you, sittin’ in your
cabin? Told you I didn’t bank on this business, maybe
you’ll remember that. Blast treasure liftin’! Leavin’
salvage aside, have you ever seen an ounce of gold raised
in all these years? There was a hundred million lyin’
off Dry Tortugas—did they ever get it? How many
ships has been down to Trinidad huntin’ for the pirates’
gold? Knight was the last man there—a lot he made of
it! It’s only the chaps that sell locations to mugs that
make money over this business, it’s my b’lief. Well, see
you aboard later on.”</p>

<p>Off he went, Ratcliffe following.</p>

<p>As they came alongside the <i>Sarah</i>, Jude was hanging
over the rail.</p>

<p>“What’s the luck?” cried Jude as they came aboard.</p>

<p>“Skelentons,” said Satan, “shipload of skulls an’ cross-bones.
Slaver, that’s what she was; dead men’s bones,
that’s your treasure.”</p>

<p>“Lord! And I’ve never seen them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
“Well, there’s nothin’ much to see,” said Satan, with
the irritating nonchalance of the one who has seen the
show; “ain’t worth the trouble of lookin’.”</p>

<p>“I want to see them skelentons,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“Tell you they ain’t wuth lookin’ at!”</p>

<p>“I want to see them—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well then, tumble into the boat, tumble into the
boat, and I’ll row you over.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe watched while the dinghy passed over to the
reef. He saw Jude on the wreck, kneeling and poring
over the cargo, held, evidently, by the fascination that lies
for youth in the horrible.</p>

<p>Then they returned, and Satan ordered the dinghy to
be taken on board.</p>

<p>“Are you going to put out now?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Put out!” said Satan, with a grin. “Why, I’ve asked
those fellers to come aboard gettin’ on for sundown, and
whether or no if I raised a foot of chain they’d be on me
with the first click of the windlass. I tell you we’re in
a tight place! Cleary said nothin’, you noticed that, but
he’s goin’ to have his forty dollars back if he knows how,
and Sellers is the same,—he wants his thousand. We’re
held for one thousand and forty dollars, and we’re not
strong enough to fight them.”</p>

<p>“Well, see here,” said the peacemaker. “Pay them.
I’ll stand the racket. It’s only a little over two hundred
pounds, and I’ll give you a check.”</p>

<p>“You don’t get me,” said Satan. “It’s not the dollars
I’m thinkin’ of so much as the game. Cark played me a
low-down trick lightin’ out for here to scoop the boodle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and Cleary laughed at me with his old cod boat outsailin’
us. They’ve got to pay. B’sides, if I was to hand over
that money, I’d never be able to show my nose again in
Havana.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Why, them two would put the laugh on me, and it’d
be ‘what price skelentons’ wherever I went, see? I’d be
the mug then. They’re the mugs now, seem’ they’ve paid
a thousand and forty for what they’ve got.”</p>

<p>“I see. But considering that they’ll be after you if
you move, and that we’re not strong enough to fight them,
what’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “when they come aboard it’ll be
either to get the dollars back or fight. You’ve noticed I
asked them to come, seein’ they’d have come whether I
asked them or not. Well, if I can foozle them into hanging
on for their answer till tomorrow, I’ll give them the
slip tonight. Moon’s not up till late.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll hear you getting the anchor up and
handling the sails!”</p>

<p>“Not with an ear trumpet,” said Satan, “if I can only
foozle them into waitin’ till tomorrow. Now then, Jude,
lend a hand with the dinghy.”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="subhead">CROCKERY WARE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">An</span> hour before sunset, Jude, on the lookout, gave the
alarm. “Sellers’s getting ready to come off,” she
cried.</p>

<p>Satan’s head appeared at the cabin hatch.</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“The boat’s alongside the <i>Juan</i> full of dagoes, and
Sellers and Cleary’s gettin’ in.”</p>

<p>“Where did you stick that bottle of nose-paint?”</p>

<p>“Starboard forward locker.”</p>

<p>“One minute.”</p>

<p>In a minute the head reappeared and an arm holding
the rum bottle.</p>

<p>“Now, mind you, I’m drunk,” said Satan, “fightin’
drunk, not to be disturbed on no account. They can call
again tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>He smashed the rum bottle on the deck.</p>

<p>“Leave the pieces lyin’.” He vanished.</p>

<p>Jude looked at Ratcliffe and grinned.</p>

<p>“Rub your nose and pretend to be cryin’,” came a voice
from below.</p>

<p>“What for should I be cryin’?” answered Jude.</p>

<p>“God A’mighty! I’ll show you if I get on deck!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Ain’t I drunk and cuttin’ up? What else would you be
doin’? <em>I’ll</em> larn you!”</p>

<p>A smash of crockery came from below that made the
housekeeper spring to the cabin skylight.</p>

<p>“Quit foolin’,” cried she. “I’m willin’ to rub the damn
nose off my head, but stop smashin’ the plates—what
have you broke?”</p>

<p>Another plate went.</p>

<p>“I’m rubbin’.”</p>

<p>“Here they are!” cried Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Jude’s nose did not seem to want any rubbing, nor her
face. Descended from generations of crockery worshipers
and careful housewives, instinctively hating
Cleary, Sellers, Cark, and all their belongings, feeling
with perfect illogic that they had been done out of the
treasure by the “skelentons” somehow through Cark, she
was convincing. Satan with rare art had worked her up
to the part. She was not crying: her mind was raging
above tears.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Kid!” cried Sellers, as the boat ground alongside
and a filthy ruffian with a handkerchief twisted round
his head clawed on with a boathook. “What’s the matter,
Kid? What’s up with you? Where’s Satan?”</p>

<p>“Who’re you kiddin’?” cried Jude, as Sellers came
aboard, followed by Cleary. “Where the hull are your
fenders? Comin’ cuttin’ the paint off, you and your
skullintons! Where’s Satan? He’s down below drunk
as Billy be damn and cuttin’ the lights out of the
ship.”</p>

<p>“He’s been at the eyewash I was tellin’ you of,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Cleary. “Look, he’s broke a bottle of it. Lord! don’t
the place stink?”</p>

<p>“Well, drunk or sober, he’s got to bail up,” said Sellers.
“It’s my belief he’s been spoofin’ us all along.”</p>

<p>“Spoofin’ who?” cried Jude.</p>

<p>“Cark an’ me.”</p>

<p>“Cark an’ you—that old leather face an’ <em>you</em>! Satan
been spoofin’ you—pair of yeggmen! Satan’s straight,
the on’y straight man in Havana! Get off this ship!
Come in the mornin’ if you want to try an’ rob him. Off
with you now!”</p>

<p>“Why,” cried Sellers, half-laughing, half-angry,
“what’s the matter with the kid? What’s gingerin’ you
up?”</p>

<p>The answer came from another smashed plate below.</p>

<p>Jude made one spring for a deck-mop standing handy,
twirled it so that the water sprayed from it in a rainbow,
and brought it to the charge.</p>

<p>Cleary slipped over the rail.</p>

<p>“Off with you!” cried Jude.</p>

<p>“Put down that mop!” cried Sellers, now suddenly
furious. “Put down that mop, you braying little bitch!
Go’n get inter your petticoats! You ain’t a boy! I
never b’lieved it, not for the last six months, an’ now I
know. You’ve give yourself away proper. Why, look
at you, as round as a tub—you’re a wumman!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe looked on horrified. Jude, flushed and bright-eyed,
had somehow revealed her sex. In her excitement
she looked for a moment almost beautiful. Her tongue
had done the rest. The smashing of the plates had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
brought the woman out of her as a conjurer brings a
rabbit out of a hat.</p>

<p>“Put down that mop!”</p>

<p>Jude from rose color had turned awfully white; then
with the élan and dash of a gamecock she charged. The
wet swab hit the ruffian full in his flat face, and he fell
on the deck with a bang.</p>

<p>In a second he was up and scrambling over the rail.
Again she charged, the swab meeting him this time full
on his stem and sending him over into the boat like a
bag of oats.</p>

<p>A slush tub, fortunately half-full, and marked by her
prescient mind, was her next weapon. The contents
caught Cleary full in the face, and as the boat made off,
the oars, all at sixes and sevens, wildly rowing, she pursued
it with the battery of her tongue till it was out of
range. Then she broke down and cried, sniffed, with her
arm hiding her face, and then flushed, like a thing of
shame dived below.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe knew.</p>

<p>Her sex proclaimed aloud by the shameless Sellers was
as a garment stripped off her publicly. On the very first
day Satan had stated her case and she didn’t mind, though
he, Ratcliffe, had been a stranger; but it was different
now, somehow. It was as if the end of her boyhood
had come. Sellers would no doubt proclaim the fact in
Havana.</p>

<p>He heard voices from below.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I’d killed him! Wish’t I had! Lea’ me
alone—for two cents I’d go drown myself! Look at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
them plates! You’ve broke the two blue pattern ones
an’ the chaney one with the bird on it, the best we had,
an’ not a cracked one touched! Hain’t you no sense?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind; I’ll get you some more.”</p>

<p>“I’m not wanting more. Them plates were mother’s—much
you care! I’ve gone as careful as walking on eggs
with them, and now they’re broke an’ the old Delf’ ones
left. If you must be breaking and cutting up, couldn’t
you a broke the cracked ones? An’ where’s the sense in
breaking them anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Waal, I reckoned it’d liven you up hearin’ the
crockery goin’.”</p>

<p>“Liven me up! Makes me believe you <em>have</em> been
getting at the rum to hear you talk. Where’s the sense
in all your doings,—ship stinking of drink and all the
crockery broke, and what’s the use?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you after dark. I tell you I want to get
away from those thugs, and if I hadn’t headed them off
pretendin’ to be drunk they’d have gone through me.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll go through you right enough tomorrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone! Why, first click of the windlass and they’ll be
aboard us.”</p>

<p>“You leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish we’d have went before you broke them
plates.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cuss the plates!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
“Easy to say that. It makes me just nacheral wild to
see that old Delf’ plate starin’ me in the face, round and
sound, and the blue pattern ones gone.”</p>

<p>Silence for a moment, at the end of which Satan’s
head and bust appeared at the cabin hatch.</p>

<p>He winked at Ratcliffe, and pointed backward with his
thumb and down below, as if indicating the domestic
trouble.</p>

<p>“There’s no sign of them swabs comin’ off again?”
asked he.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ratcliffe. “They seem to have had enough
of it.”</p>

<p>The rum bottle had broken fairly in two without
splinters.</p>

<p>“You might heave the bottle over, like a good one,”
said Satan. “I can’t show on deck for fear of those
shrimps seein’ me. It’ll be dark in an hour, and then I’ll
be up. You can wait for your supper till we get away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Ratcliffe; “I’m in no hurry.”</p>

<span class="subhead">TIDE AND CURRENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">He</span> lit a pipe. Having disposed of the fragments of
the bottle, he got the mop and a bucket of water
and swabbed the rum-stained deck. Then he took his
seat forward and watched the sunset.</p>

<p>The great sun, half-shorn of his beams and bulging
broad as Jupiter, lolled above the reef in a sky of
laburnum gold fading to aquamarine. Gulls, dark as
withered leaves, blew about him, and shifting here and
there to north and south became gulls of gold, while the
wind blowing up from the gulf and the westward running
current, meeting the last of the flood, broke the sea surface
into a million tiny dancing waves, momentary
mirrors dazzling the eye with shattered light.</p>

<p>Lone Reef seemed well named. Dawn or sunset or
the blaze of full day could not take from its desolation,
and this evening the sinister line of the wreck dominated
everything, turning the blaze of sunset to the light of a
funeral pyre.</p>

<p>The <i>Sarah</i>, moving to the swell, creaked and whimpered,
and now and then from below he could hear voices,—Jude’s
voice and the voice of Satan. Beyond that
came the murmur of the reef and the clang of the gulls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
and now and again a snatch of Spanish song from the
<i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>Then the sun passed below the reef, the tide began to
draw out, and the <i>Sarah</i>, swinging to it, brought to his
view the <i>Juan</i> and the <i>Natchez</i>, ships of dusk in a world
of dusk powdered with star dust. Presently a light was
run up on the <i>Natchez</i>, then the <i>Juan</i> put up her riding
light, then Satan appeared, a dusky form, rising from
the cabin hatch and followed by Jude.</p>

<p>They came forward. Jude squatted on the deck, and
Satan drew close to Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Now, if them skunks had any sense in their skulls,
they’d stick out a guard boat,” said Satan; “but I’ve fair
put the hood on them, I b’lieve, and they’ve never saw
what I was after, pretendin’ I had no oil for an anchor
light. Why, they are only fit to be put out to nuss!
Half an hour more and we’ll be off.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“Knock the shackle off the anchor chain an’ let her
drift. Tide an’ current is runnin’ four knots.”</p>

<p>“But even without the anchor light they’ll be able to
see us by the stars.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless you! at this distance they won’t be able
to see mor’n a glimpse of us. We’ll go so gradual they
won’t notice. If they keep a lookout at all,—which they
won’t, ten to one,—he’ll see us by believin’ we’re there.”</p>

<p>“Lord! I’d love to see their faces in the morning!”
murmured Jude.</p>

<p>“But won’t they go for you when we get back to
Havana?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
“Not they,” said Satan. “They’ll say nothin’, seein’ as
how they’re done and the laugh’s against them. Why,
Cark will respect me more for this job than if I’d run
straight with him over the biggest deal. If it’d been the
other way about and he’d pulled the dollars off me, I’d
have been nowhere with him. Mind you out here, if I
was to stick here till tomorrow, they’d be aboard and
maybe manhandling us if I didn’t bail up; but back in
Havana the thing will be closed and the accounts wrote
off.”</p>

<p>The sound of a guitar came through the dusk, crossing
the warm wind, the lazy, languorous wind of a perfect
summer’s night. Seville, which he had never seen, rose
before Ratcliffe, firefly-haunted orange groves, lovely
women all skewered together by the remembered words of
a ribald song.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When I was a student at Cadiz!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“There goes old Catguts,” said Satan. “He’s the band
aboard the <i>Juan</i>,—Antonio, Alonzo, Alphonso—damn his
name!”</p>

<p>“It ain’t,” said Jude. “It’s that old copper-patch
Cleary’s got with him. I’ve heard him in harbor. I gave
him a plug of tobacco once for getting me some bait, and
he showed me the thing. It’s got a crack in it or suthin’,
and makes a noise like a skeeter in a jug,—kind a fizzin’
noise between the plonks. He’s got an ulster on his leg
so’s you can see the bone. He took off the rags an’
showed me—he’s a Portugee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“Well, it’s time to get busy,” said Satan. “Here, h’ist
yourself and lend a hand!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe got more forward while they knocked the
shackle off the chain. There came a splash. Then the
meeting resumed.</p>

<p>“If they heard that splash,” said Satan, “they’d put
it down to a fish jumpin’. Now you watch them lights.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe watched the amber lights of the <i>Natchez</i> and
<i>Juan</i>. They did not seem to alter position in the least.
In the first of the starlight and the last of the dusk the
spars and hulls of the two vessels could just be made out.</p>

<p>Then presently he saw that the lights had drawn a
bit more aft and seemed closer together. The feel of the
<i>Sarah</i> was different too, she moved more freely to the
swell.</p>

<p>The sound of the guitar seemed slightly fainter.</p>

<p>Now and then the beguiling sea would give the <i>Sarah</i>
a little slap, no louder than the slap of a girl’s hand,
on the low planking as if joking with her over some secret
shared in common.</p>

<p>Yes, the sound of the guitar was fainter, much fainter,
and the spars and hulls of the vessels now invisible as
though they had been dissolved in the gloom.</p>

<p>The anchor lights alone marked their places.</p>

<p>“We’re all right now,” said Satan; “but I’ll give them
another five minutes. Got the matches for the binnacle
light?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jude.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, then they got the canvas on her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
and Satan, at the wheel, taking his bearings from the
far-off lights of the betrayed ones, turned the spokes.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to sail for?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Cormorant Cay,” said Satan. “I’ve a fancy to look
at that place.”</p>

<span class="subhead">SATAN IN PARADISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">He</span> had divided Ratcliffe and Jude into watches, port
and starboard.</p>

<p>Jude turned in first, relieving him somewhere about two
in the morning. At six, when Ratcliffe turned out and
came on deck, he found Satan at the wheel, relinquished
by Jude, and day pursuing the Sarah across a wrinkled
sea of tourmaline and hinted blue. Away ahead somewhere
to the south lay Cormorant Cay, the true tomb, if
the chart indications were correct, of the <i>Nombre de Dios</i>.</p>

<p>A strong sailing wind was blowing, and Satan gave
their speed at seven knots. He refused to hand over the
wheel.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a snooze on deck,” said he, “while the kid
took charge. We’re nearly sixty miles south of Lone,
and if this wind holds will be on to Cormorant somewhere
about eight bells.”</p>

<p>“Not a sign of those chaps,” said Ratcliffe, looking
back over the sea, clear of Cleary and Sellers and their
dirty crowd.</p>

<p>“Naw; they’ll be just about rousin’ up now and rubbin’
their eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
“You don’t think they’ll try to follow us?”</p>

<p>“Not likely, I don’t think. They’re wastin’ time and
money if they cruise after us. Cark’s got his business
in Havana to attend to, and Cleary’s the same. What’s
gettin’ me is the fac’ that Sellers has spotted the kid for
what she is. It’ll be all over Havana, and she knows it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it had to come out some time.”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Satan!” said Ratcliffe. “I’ve been thinking
a lot about the girl and what’s to become of her. She
can’t go on as she is. We must fix up something.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy said.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve grown fonder of her than any person I’ve
ever met, that’s the truth. There’s no one like her; she’s
gold right through.”</p>

<p>“She ain’t bad.”</p>

<p>“This sort of thing was all right when she was a
child,” went on Ratcliffe; “but she’s growing out of that.
Why, even in the little time since I’ve come aboard, she
seems different, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me,” said Satan, “you seem to have
made a change in her. She’s brightened up, somehow,
has more sass in her. Y’see, when we were cruisin’
round since Pap died, me, she, and the nigger, there
wasn’t much company, and she was gettin’ a bit down-hearted.
Then, when you came aboard, she picked up.
She hadn’t laughed for weeks till she saw you in that
pajama rig; then she chummed onto you.”</p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>“Liked you from the first minute she saw you. There’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
no two ways about Jude,—it’s either like or the other
thing, right off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m pretty much the same—and I don’t want
to lose sight of her—or you.”</p>

<p>“How’d you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just that. I’m bothering about when this cruise
is over. That’s bothering me a lot. Well, we’ll leave
it at that for the present.”</p>

<p>Satan turned his lantern face to starboard for half a
moment to expectorate right over the starboard rail—maybe
also to hide a grin.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’ll come all right somehow,” said he. “We
ain’t much in the world, but we’re straight. Reckon
you’re straight too. That’s all I want. That feller
Thelusson, y’remember I told you he wanted to come
for a cruise with us. Well, he was straight enough s’far
as dollars went, but I wouldn’t have had him on this
ship, not if he’d paid me a dollar a minute and a bonus
for every knot we made—not with Jude aboard—Here’s
the wheel for a sec’, if you’ll take it whiles I get some
coffee ready.”</p>

<p>Toward noon a wreath of gulls in the sky showed
Cormorant.</p>

<p>Jude was at the wheel, Satan forward on the lookout.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Satan came running aft, fetched
the old glass out of its sling, and went forward with
it.</p>

<p>“There’s a hooker on the sands!” cried he. “Looks
like a small fruiter or suthin’ hove up.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, standing beside him, could see nothing,—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
sand, owing to their low level, was invisible from the
deck of the <i>Sarah</i>,—then, straining his eyes, he made
out a speck on the sea-line.</p>

<p>“Mast’s gone,” said Satan, “white painted, not more’n
fifty ton, and she’s layin’ in the lagoon. She must have
come in over the sand where it narrows to the westward.
There’s a pinch of sand there that’s near under water
at flood, and the seas come right over it in an east’ard
gale.”</p>

<p>He handed the glass to Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Funny,” said Ratcliffe, “if you were right about the
<i>Nombre de Dios</i> being sunk here and we come to have a
look for her and find another wreck.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t take no shares in the <i>Nombre de Dios</i>,”
said Satan. “I ran here more for somewhere to run to
than with any thought of the <i>Nombre</i>. She’s a hundred
foot under the sand if she’s here at all; but it’s luck all
the same. There’ll be pickin’s. There was a big blow
two weeks ago from the east,—that’s what’s done her,—and
the salvage men won’t be here yet, if they ever come.”</p>

<p>He stuck the glass to his eye.</p>

<p>“She’s a yacht, that’s what she is, one of them small
cruisers, not more’n fifty or sixty, and her fittin’s will
just do for us, if she’s not been stripped. There’s all
sorts of folks come from New York and Philadelphia
and N’ y’Orleans, cruisin’ about these seas in tubs like
that,—fishin’ mostly.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sarah</i> held on, almost due south, with the daring
of a sea-bird, Satan giving directions to the steersman
and seeming absolutely regardless of the death and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
dangers around them,—reefs that they shaved, rocks that
waved fathom-long ribbons of fuci a few feet under
water,—he avoided them all.</p>

<p>South, east, and west Cormorant Cay is devoid of
danger. Only here to the north do the reefs and rocks
show, and it is just here that the only entrance to the
lagoon lies.</p>

<p>The place consists really of two sandspits widely
separated to the north so as to form a pondlike harbor
running from five to ten fathoms deep. Farther south
the sandspits join so as to form a wide street, like the
spit to eastward of Lone Reef.</p>

<p>They held on. The sound of the gentle surf on the
sands came now, and a full view of the lagoon water
reflecting the sun blaze like a mirror.</p>

<p>On the still lagoon, with strange stereoscopic effect
seen between the two sand-arms holding off the wrinkled
sea, lay the craft, floating on an even keel, and showing
a stump of mainmast against the skyline. From her
lines she had been a yacht.</p>

<p>“Why, Go’ bless my soul, she’s anchored!” cried
Satan. “Derelic’ and anchored. The people must have
got away in a boat or suthin’. There’s not a sign of
them. Port—hard—port—as you were—steady—so!”</p>

<p>He ran to let go the halyards.</p>

<p>Another anchor had been bent on to some spare
chain. It was heaved over, and the <i>Sarah</i> came up to it,
swinging less than fifty yards from the stranger. She
was a picture, a forty-ton fishing yawl, white painted,
gracile as a fish, dismasted, abandoned, and swinging to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
taut anchor chain; beyond her and the emerald of the
lagoon lay the great stretch of sands, running due south,
blanketing to the heat and showing ponds of aquamarine
and storms of gulls.</p>

<p>The anchor down, Satan stood with his eyes fixed on
his prey; Jude too. They seemed considering her as a
butcher might consider a carcass before he cut it up.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to board her?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a dead b’ar?” asked Satan.
“Sometimes a b’ar isn’t as dead as he looks, and sometimes
a derelic’ isn’t as empty as it looks. It’s a common thing
for men on the Florida coast to hide in a driftin’ canoe
and rise up and laugh at them that come out to collect it.
I can’t make out that anchor chain bein’ down, and I’ll
just give them one hour whiles we have dinner.”</p>

<p>When they came on deck again after the meal, they
dropped the dinghy, and the three of them put off for
the derelict.</p>

<p>She must have been dismasted outside the sands, for
not a spar lay in the water alongside,—dismasted and
driven over by a big wave, her crew clinging to her.
On the bow was her name, <i>Haliotis</i>. They tied up
and scrambled on board. The deck ran flush fore and
aft. The wheel looked all right, but was jammed and
immovable; the binnacle glass was smashed.</p>

<p>Satan stood, whistling and looking about him. Then
he dived below, followed by the others. The cabin had
been left in good order. It was a bit over-gilded and
decorated for a plain man’s taste, but everything was of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the best, and a hanging lamp of solid brass still swung
over the center-table. The walls were of bird’s-eye maple,
the cushions of the best blue cloth, and the fittings of
the tiny sleeping cabins to match.</p>

<p>There was plenty of stuff lying about,—books, clothes,
boots. The people had evidently put off in a hurry, not
caring much what they took as long as they got away.
Perhaps they had taken advantage of a passing steamer.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe picked up a book, a volume of O. Henry.
There was a name in it,—J. Seligmann.</p>

<p>Jude, delving in the starboard after-cabin, came out
holding up something. It was a pair of boots, women’s,
patent leather with white suede tops and heels three inches
high.</p>

<p>“Look at them things!” said Jude with a burst of suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p>“A girl’s boots,” said Ratcliffe. “Try them on, Jude.”</p>

<p>“If I wore them things,” said Jude, “I’d have to walk
on my hands. There’s dead loads more of stuff, and the
place smells as if a polecat had been living there.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe stuck his head into the little cabin. It
reeked of California poppy as though a bottle of it
had been upset, California poppy and cosmetic scents.
Clothes were lying about in disorder; a woman’s white
yachting cap, deck shoes, lingerie, bursting like froth out
of a cabin trunk, gave added touch to the hysterical distraction
of the scene.</p>

<p>One could see her, the woman, rushing about saving
or collecting her valuables, leaving everything else, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
calling on the gods to witness that she would never set
foot again on another small yacht for a pleasure cruise
among the islands.</p>

<p>Jude picked out a frilled garment from the lingerie
box, looked at it, rolled it up, and cast it with a chuckle
into the bunk, then she reached up and opened the little
port.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe left her pursuing her investigations, attracted
by the whoops of Satan, who seemed pursuing things
about the deck.</p>

<p>Satan, with his hair wild and his eyes ablaze, had
rapidly sampled his treasure. Everything he wanted had
been left. Had he found the <i>Nombre de Dios</i> with gold
to her hatches, it is doubtful if his excitement would have
been so intense.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried he, pointing to the mast winch.
“Wantin’ it—should think I had been! Come along and
see!” He led the way to a heap of raffle and broken
spars forward. “Look at them gaff jaws, galvanized an’
covered with hide, and me with old wooden ones
creakin’ like an old shoe! There’s a mainsheet buffer too!
Camper Nicholson’s—rubber—cringles—come along to
the sail room!”</p>

<p>They went to the sail room, then to the galley,—everywhere
finds, glorious finds, with this rough sum total:</p>

<p>In the sail room, sixty fathoms of new manila rope,
an eighty-foot otter trawl, harpoons and grains and a
seine net, a trysail, square sails, two jibs; in the galley,
cooking gear, an Atkey cooking stove to burn coal or
coke; in addition to all this some splendid blocks with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
patent sheaves with ball bearings which run so much
better than dummies, a lower mainsheet block and two
quarter-blocks, fathoms of galvanized chain, and two
Nicholson’s patent anchors. Other things included
lamps, a pair of binoculars, a sextant and a chronometer,
charts, and lastly, glorious but useless, in a little engine
room the auxiliary, a 13–15 horse-power petrol-paraffin
Kelvin engine, two-cylinder, with the shaft running out
through the quarter, and a spare Bergius propeller,
which shuts up and opens out automatically when in
motion.</p>

<p>When they came on deck again after a rapid glance
at these things a brain-wave came to Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said he. “Why not tow her back to
Havana and claim salvage? She’s worth a lot and she’s
derelict.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said Satan. “Have you ever claimed salvage?
First there’s the tow, and we’re underhanded.
Then there’s the lawyers. What’s to stop this Seligmann
whoever he is poppin’ up an’ swearin’ against me.
He’d say he left her with the anchor down in harbor;
it amounts to that, though she’s derelic’ right enough.
Not me! I’ll take what I want without no lawyers to
help me. She’s my meat, by all the laws of the sea, and
that’s the end of it.”</p>

<p>Appeared Jude from the cabin hatch, carrying as a
trophy a go-ashore hat she had unearthed from somewhere,
a crushed-strawberry-colored straw hat—or was
it a bonnet? It had long strings and a rose stuck on one
side of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
“Look what that catawampus has left behind her!”
cried Jude.</p>

<p>“Quit your foolin’,” cried Satan, “and come along and
lend a hand. Here, h’ist these things into the dinghy!”</p>

<p>Jude flung the hat down the open skylight, and the
rank burglary of the <i>Haliotis</i> began.</p>

<span class="subhead">A SECRET OF THE SAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> seemed to Ratcliffe in the days that followed that
he had never known what work meant before. That
he, a wealthy and respected member of the British upper,
upper-middle classes, an ex-Christ Churchman, and a
member of Boodles, was assisting Satan Tyler in “tearing
the tripes” out of another man’s yacht, also occurred to
him sometimes as a fact, a distorted sort of fact, blurred
and dimmed by the blazing and brilliant atmosphere in
which they were working, the absolute and shocking
loneliness that hemmed them in, Satan’s personality, and
Jude’s companionship.</p>

<p>By all the laws of the sea, according to Satan, these
things were the property of the first finder. That was
all very well according to Satan, and indeed according to
what seemed common-sense; still, sea law was for all he
could tell not quite the same thing as the laws of the
sea, according to Satan. Though belonging to a great
ship-owning family, he knew nothing of the rights of the
matter; but the business they were engaged on seemed to
him sometimes, when he cared to think, most tremendously
like larceny,—larceny excused by a lot of considerations
and made picturesque by environment; still, a business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
that in the unpicturesque surroundings of the London
Sessions would undoubtedly have appealed to a judge
in the voice of Larceny.</p>

<p>Sometimes he imagined a warship, one of those prying,
officious little cruisers that do police work, closing up
with the cay and sending a boat into the lagoon.</p>

<p>Sometimes he fell to wondering what Seligmann was
like,—an American surely, one of the Gulf haunters, belonging,
most probably, to one of the numerous clubs on
the Florida coast, and Mrs. Seligmann—or was it Miss—or
not even that?</p>

<p>One thing was certain, Seligmann was rich. They
were not robbing a poor man.</p>

<p>At the end of the third day Jude gave out, not from
weariness, but from distaste.</p>

<p>“Lord! haven’t you had enough of this old truck?”
said Jude. “I don’t feel’s if I ever wanted to see a
len’th of rope nor a cringle again.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe felt pretty much the same.</p>

<p>“I’ll finish the business myself,” said Satan. “You
can knock off if you like. Go’n hunt for turkles’ eggs.”</p>

<p>“I’m going,” said Jude.</p>

<p>“I’ll come along, too,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Satan ferried them over to the sands. It was about
two hours before sundown, and an easterly breeze was
blowing fresh and cool, shivering up the lagoon water
and whispering among the sand-grains.</p>

<p>Jude walked despondently as they trudged along close
to the sea edge and discovering nothing.</p>

<p>“D’you know,” said Ratcliffe, “we’ve never even started<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
to hunt for a sign of the <i>Nombre de Dios</i>? I wonder if
she’s sunk, really, anywhere near here?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Jude; “don’t care, nuther. Satan’s
so full of his pesky old fittings he’s no time to think of
anything else.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Jude.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not. What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Lots of things.”</p>

<p>“When we get back to Havana—” began Ratcliffe.
She cut him short.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go back to Havana,” said she. “Ain’t
going.”</p>

<p>She sat down on the sands plump, nursed her knees,
and stared over the sea, casting her hat beside her. He
stood for a moment, then he sat down. He knew at once,
knew what had been working in her mind for days.</p>

<p>“You’re bothering about what Sellers said, dirty
scoundrel! I’d have punched his head, only the whole
thing happened so quick and you landed him with that
mop—don’t worry.”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“What’s the good?” went on Ratcliffe; then cautiously
and feeling that he was treading on dangerous ground,
“See here, there’s no harm in being a girl, no more than
there is in being a man.”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>A laughing gull passed and jeered at them. Jude followed
it with her eyes. She seemed almost unconscious
of his presence and not to have heard his words. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
watched her profile against the sky, noticed the eyelashes
which seemed longer and more carved up than ever, the
nice shape of the head, free of the old panama.</p>

<p>Then she turned, leaned on her elbow, and looked up
at him—then she looked down.</p>

<p>“What made you think I was botherin’ about Sellers?”
asked Jude.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ratcliffe, “I just thought it. I’ve
been thinking a lot about you—I care for you a lot, that’s
about it.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him again, full in the eyes, and with
a new expression he had never seen before, a puzzled,
half-startled look, like that of a person suddenly
awakened in strange surroundings.</p>

<p>Then her eyes fell away from him.</p>

<p>She took a handful of sand and let the grains fall between
her fingers.</p>

<p>“Just that,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>She was still playing with the sand, letting it fall between
her fingers carefully as though trying to count
the grains. Then she threw the stuff away, brushed the
palm of her hand clean, and sat up. Drawing a little
closer to her, he put his hand round her waist, just as
he had done when they were on the sandspit, and just as
on the sandspit, she let it rest there—for a moment.
Then, with a queer little laugh, she removed the hand and
struggled to her feet.</p>

<p>He rose up and they went on, without a word. Then
presently they began to talk about indifferent matters almost
as though nothing had occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
They found a nest of turtles’ eggs, and Jude marked
it; farther along they came upon something strange, a
sort of platform half-covered with sand. Jude said it
was the foretop of a ship sunk and sanded over.</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, maybe,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Jude. “It’s the foretop of an old ship,
anyhow. See, where the mast’s broke off—she’s thirty
or forty foot under that.”</p>

<p>“Not much good to us, even if she is the <i>Nombre de
Dios</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>The gulls seemed to agree, and the little waves, falling
crystal clear on the beach.</p>

<p>It was near the end of the spit just here, and the
sands shelved out, losing themselves in the immeasurable
loneliness of the sea stretching to Mariguana and the
Caicos and the northern shoulder of South America.</p>

<p>Jude, on her knees with a bit of driftwood, was scraping
away the sand from the edge of the sunk foretop,
when something caught her eye.</p>

<p>A turtle had landed where they had marked the eggs.
It was so far away that it did not look bigger than a
threepenny bit.</p>

<p>She flung the bit of driftwood away, rose to her feet,
and started running, taking the extreme sea-edge where
the sand was hard. Ratcliffe followed. They were half
a minute too late, the turtle turning back to the sea and
leaving them spent and laughing. She got down on her
knees and hived the eggs in her hat still laughing. He
helped, filling his hat and his pockets, and then they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
started for the lagoon edge, Jude suddenly in the wildest
spirits. He had never seen her in such high, good
spirits. When they got aboard it was just the same.
Even Satan’s maniacal passion for old junk, expressed at
supper in the determination to spend two more days
picking and scraping at the <i>Haliotis</i>, did not depress her,
it only made her laugh.</p>

<p>“You’ll be cryin’ before you’ve done if you go on
laughin’ like that,” said Satan. “What’s possessed you
eh?”</p>

<p>Sure enough she was. The words acted like a pin on
a bubble.</p>

<p>She flushed, pushed her plate away, half rose, and then
sat down again.</p>

<p>“You’re always going on at me! Whatch’a want me
to do? If I’m crying, I ought to be laughin’, an’ if I’m
laughin’ I ought to be crying! I’ll laugh as much as I
want—”</p>

<p>Then, logically, she broke into violent tears, rose, and
ran on deck.</p>

<p>“What the hell-nation’s the matter with her?” asked
Satan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Ratcliffe.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE GO-ASHORE HAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">He</span> had time to think over the matter as he lay in
his bunk that night.</p>

<p>He fell to wondering, among other things, what the
spell was that drew him toward Jude and held him.</p>

<p>Was it the indefinable attractive quality that had made
her mother a “nacheral calamity” where men were concerned,
or just the power of youth? Scarcely the latter.
He had met lots of youth in his time, and it had not
attracted him much; besides, when you have only to look
into the looking-glass to see youth, it is at a discount.</p>

<p>Puzzling over the matter, he came to the bedrock fact
that Jude, in some extraordinary way, had the power to
make him feel more alive than he had ever felt before.</p>

<p>Leaving other things aside, there were an honesty,
faithfulness, and simplicity about Jude that removed her
from the category of bifurcated beings and raised her to
the level of a dog.</p>

<p>Instinct told him that this compound quality was worth
more than all the gold lying under the hatches of the
<i>Nombre de Dios</i>, more than all the diamonds in the
Rand, when combined with that other quality speaking in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
her level gaze,—steadfastness, the something that would
make her keep the wheel in all weathers.</p>

<p>But these excellencies would have been nothing without
the impossibilities with which they were allied,—social
and conventual impossibilities. The one reacted on
the other, making an irresistible whole combined with
the something else that was Jude.</p>

<p>He remembered the queer little laugh with which she
had freed herself from his hand round her waist—then
he fell asleep and dreamt that he and Jude and a lot of
larrikins were lying in wait by a harbor blue as the sea
off Jamaica, to clod bathing nigger girls; then he was
chasing Jude round and round a tree, only to catch her
and find that she was Carquinez.</p>

<p>When he got on deck next morning he found the ship
deserted. The others were away on the sandbank, and
he amused himself by fishing till they returned.</p>

<p>Jude showed no traces of the tears of the last night,
and Satan was elated. He had been examining the
wreck-wood, and his experienced eye backed the declaration
of Jude. It was the foretop of a ship, right enough,
and, a hundred to one, so he declared, the foretop of the
<i>Nombre</i>.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, wondering vaguely why he seemed so pleased
over the find, considering the sand conditions, asked him
the chances of raising her. Then said Satan, seeming
to turn his gaze inward upon his awful and profound
knowledge of the sea and its ways:</p>

<p>“If you was to get all the dridgers from H’vana to
Pensacola and dridged till your eyes bugged out o’ your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
head an’ your tongue hanged down to your heels, you
wouldn’t clear her—siltin’—but she’s a sure enough mug
trap.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, with that story and that chart an’ that old
foretop, I could set half Havana diggin’ like dogs for a
bone, to say nothin’ of private parties an’ syndikits an’
such things—maybe I will, too, some day.”</p>

<p>They put out after breakfast for the <i>Haliotis</i> and another
load of “old junk.” Satan rowed back with it,
leaving Jude and Ratcliffe on board,—Ratcliffe collecting
things forward, and Jude grubbing about in the
saloon.</p>

<p>Having collected the odds and ends in a heap, he
turned his eyes to the <i>Sarah</i>. Satan, having tied up the
dinghy, was busy transhipping his plunder. Then the
beauty of the morning sea flooding into the lagoon, held
him for a moment. He followed the gulls in their flight,
noted the sudden break from emerald to ultramarine
deepening to purple, and beyond the reefs the sudden
glitter of a leaping fish. Then he remembered Jude down
below.</p>

<p>He came to the companionway and down the stairs.</p>

<p>The cabin was brilliant with sunlight, with water reflections
through the open portholes playing on the ceiling
and polished maple and venesta of the walls. Across
a pile of truck and bunk bedding heaped on the table he
caught a glimpse of the upper part of Jude.</p>

<p>Jude, fancying herself entirely alone, and yielding to
some prompting or other, had picked up the despised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
go-ashore hat and put it on; she was looking at herself
in the mirror fixed to the after bulkhead. She was looking
at herself with her head now straight and now tilted
slightly to one side; then the head turned, but she did
not see Ratcliffe: her eyes were still fixed on the hat,
she was looking at it sidewise.</p>

<p>All her unconscious movements might have been those
of a lady in a milliner’s shop trying on a hat in a critical
spirit.</p>

<p>She had not heard him coming down the companionway,
owing to the fact that he was in his bare feet, and
she did not hear him go up again.</p>

<p>On deck he took his seat on an old box upended close
to the mainmast stump, and considered the thing he had
just witnessed in a philosophical spirit.</p>

<p>It was like seeing a chrysalis crack and a butterfly’s
wing protruding.</p>

<p>If Jude had not been admiring herself in that hat, then
sight was a liar and its evidence worthless. But Jude
was as honest as the day. She had greeted the thing
with derision, brought it on deck to show as an object
of mirth, and flung it down the skylight opening with contempt—yesterday
morning.</p>

<p>What had happened since then to make her consider
the thing at all, let alone wear it before a looking-glass?</p>

<p>Had she put it on in derision and to see what a guy
she looked? Not a bit! She had made friends with
that hat! Those few movements of the head spoke of
consideration not derision, in a language old as the earliest
feather headdress and more universal than Esperanto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Then he remembered last evening on the sandspit and
her sudden passage from despondency to high spirits; he
remembered her queer little laugh as she removed his
hand from round her waist,—had that been the sound of
the rift coming in the chrysalis casing?</p>

<p>For a moment he almost yielded to the desire to go
below and see if the butterfly had really arrived. Then
he checked himself. There was time, plenty of time; besides,
Satan was putting off again in the dinghy for another
load.</p>

<p>Satan, over this business, like a man in drink or a
lunatic, had his hot fits and cold fits. A hot fit had suddenly
come on him.</p>

<p>The petrol-paraffin engine had begun suddenly to shout
to him that it must be taken. A glorious idea, too, had
evolved itself in his brain,—why not fit it to the <i>Sarah</i>;
not there in the lagoon, of course, but in some port?
All that was required would be some structural alterations
and a shaft-hole in the quarter; he reckoned the
fitting would cost under three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>He didn’t want the thing, really,—masts and sails were
good enough for his pottering-about work,—it was the
passion of a woman for jewelry. The <i>Sarah</i> would be
a nobbier boat with an auxiliary,—sea swank, purely, exhibiting
the only apparent weak spot in his character.</p>

<p>That spare Bergius propeller had begun revolving in
his mind days ago,—“thrud—thrud—thrud! See me
drive the <i>Sarah</i>, see me drive the <i>Sarah</i>!” He had examined
the propeller already attached and found the
blades all broken. The shaft was intact, and, beaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the <i>Haliotis</i> stern on in that quiet lagoon, it would have
been possible to fit on the spare one and take her off
unmasted, as she was under her own motive power.</p>

<p>He had a vague notion of the structure of engines and
Yankee ingenuity enough to have driven her, but the
fact of her anchor being down, as before stated, and the
fact that he had already “torn the tripes” out of her
plundered the sail room and the store room, removed
brasswork that would have taken weeks to replace, and
generally left her like a scooped cheese, prevented an
idea of salvage.</p>

<p>Taking the <i>Haliotis</i> into port he would have to declare
her like a box of cigars,—a box of cigars belonging to
another man and half the cigars gone.</p>

<p>Coming over the rail, Ratcliffe saw the new light in
his eye and wondered what it portended.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinkin’,” said Satan, taking his stand by the
mast stump and surveying the heap of stuff collected by
the other, “I’ve been thinkin’ it’s tomfoolery to leave that
engine.”</p>

<p>Jude, brought up by the sound of the dinghy coming
alongside, appeared at the saloon companionway. She
wore no hat.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” said Ratcliffe, aghast. “You don’t
mean to say—but it’s impossible. We haven’t the means
to take it.”</p>

<p>“There’s enough of the mast left to rig a tackle to,”
said Satan, “and that hatch leads right down to the
engine place. The heavy fittin’s are easy raised from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
bed-plates, and they’re not too heavy to go in the dinghy.
We can tow her with the c’lapsible.”</p>

<p>“But what can you do with the thing?”</p>

<p>“Fit her to the <i>Sarah</i>, of course.”</p>

<p>“Here, in the lagoon?” asked the horrified Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t mind if I had the hands and the
tools for the job,” replied Satan. “Naw, it’s beyont me.
I’ll have to take her to a port to have it done,—not
Havana, neither: there’s too many eyes in Havana and
people that know my business. Vera Cruz is the place.
I know a Spanish yard there’ll do the job.”</p>

<p>“The year after next,” put in Jude, “supposing you do
manage to get it aboard, you know what the dagoes are,
and you’ll knock the inside of the <i>Sarah</i> to flinders. She
won’t be the same boat with that old traction injin in
her—I wish we’d never struck this cay!”</p>

<p>She sat down on the combing of the skylight and
folded her hands. Ratcliffe had never seen her do that
before. He stood torn between two things,—the desire
to please Satan and the desire to please Jude. Pulling
on the side of Jude there was also the sure foreknowledge
of the heavy work that would be required. That did not
frighten him; but it did seem to him that they had done
enough and ought to be satisfied. It was like burglars
going for the kitchen boiler after having removed the
plate, furniture, and very bed-linen of a house.</p>

<p>All the same he could not but admire Satan. Time
was pressing, it was quite possible that a salvage boat
might poke her nose into the lagoon at any moment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Satan knew this as well as he, yet it did not move him.</p>

<p>“It’s not a dago yard,” said Satan, evading the traction
engine dig, “it’s French, and I’ve been wanting an
auxiliary for years. Pap was with me, only he was
awful slow over business, and here’s one for nix. I’m
goin’ down to have a look at her.”</p>

<p>He dived below.</p>

<p>Jude sat brooding.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Ratcliffe. “It’s not a big engine,
and he and I will be able to do it with a tackle. I’m not
going to let him put you to work on it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not bothering about that,” said Jude fatefully.
“It’s when it’s fixed up I’m thinking of.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“He’ll make me drive the durned thing.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t.”</p>

<p>“What’s to stop him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots of things—leave it to me.”</p>

<p>He was cut short by Satan’s voice calling him to come
below. Down below he had to follow all sorts of details
pointed out, details proving the desirability of the prize
and the miraculous ease of its removal.</p>

<p>Then they came on deck and put off for dinner. But
Satan was never destined to lift that engine. Fate had
fixed it to its bed-plates more securely than screws and
nuts could hold it.</p>

<span class="subhead">CLEARY!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Dinner</span> was over and Jude had run up on deck.
Suddenly her voice came down through the open
skylight.</p>

<p>“Below there! Cleary’s coming!”</p>

<p>Satan jumped from his place like a man shot. Next
moment he was on deck. Jude pointed and handed him
the binoculars she had been using.</p>

<p>“That’s them!” said Satan, after a long look. “Cuss
the swabs!”</p>

<p>He handed the glasses to Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Away to the north two sails cut the sea-line. With
the aid of the glasses two vessels leaped into view,—a
topsail schooner and a smaller vessel of fore-and-aft
rig. Even with the glasses he could not have been sure
that these were the <i>Natchez</i> and the <i>Juan</i> like a pair
of evil dogs hunting in company; but Satan was sure,
so was Jude.</p>

<p>“They’re coming dead for the cay,” said Jude. Satan
said nothing.</p>

<p>He had been filling his pipe when the hail came, he
lit it now, walked to the starboard rail to be alone, and
stood with his eyes fixed on the <i>Haliotis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
The position was as bad as could be. First of all,
these ruffians would be sure to make him bail up even
more than he had had out of them; secondly, they would
have the laugh at him and post him as a mug all over
Havana; thirdly, they would give him away about the
<i>Haliotis</i>, if they discovered how he had plundered her.</p>

<p>Having smoked for a moment in silence, he turned
to his companions.</p>

<p>It was a boast of Satan’s that he had never lost a
spar, a fact partly due to luck, partly to his foreseeing
eye; like a good general, he had plans for all eventualities.</p>

<p>“They won’t be in the lagoon for a couple of hours,”
said he, “with this wind and all. Come on aboard the
old tub.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Jude. “Sink her
at her moorings?”</p>

<p>“No time; besides, they’d see her on the lagoon floor.
It’s up anchor and let her drift on the sands.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! Don’t stand jibberin’! I’ve got my plan.
Into the dinghy with you!”</p>

<p>They rowed over to the <i>Haliotis</i>.</p>

<p>The one thing that Satan had not coveted was, mercifully,
the winch; it was of the type of the West Country
winch, and not a spot on Pap’s patent, at least in
Satan’s eyes.</p>

<p>They set to, got the anchor in, secured it, and rowed
back to the <i>Sarah</i>. Then they watched the <i>Haliotis</i> drift.
The tide was going out. She was close to the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
arm of the spit, and that arm had a bead in it toward
the narrowing entry.</p>

<p>Satan reckoned she would take the sand a hundred
yards or so from the entry, and he reckoned right.</p>

<p>But they had no time to watch her. The deck of the
<i>Sarah</i> was lumbered with stuff that bad to be stowed out
of sight. It took an hour before everything was shipshape
and snug, and by that time the oncomers were
close in, their sails big bellied with the wind, beating
up for the entrance.</p>

<p>They came through, the <i>Juan</i> leading, the <i>Natchez</i>
some two cable lengths behind; then, with canvas threshing
and the gulls yelling round them, they dropped their
anchors, the <i>Juan</i> to starboard of the <i>Sarah</i> and the
<i>Natchez</i> farther up the lagoon. Ratcliffe had expected
demonstrations of hostility: there were none.</p>

<p>They could see Sellers directing the fellows forward,
and they could make out Cleary on the deck of the
<i>Natchez</i>. Then they saw Sellers drop below, and
through the binoculars they could see Cleary as though
he were only a few yards off,—he was smoking and
giving orders to the hands. Then he came and spat over
the rail and stood looking toward the <i>Sarah</i> with his eyes
shaded; having finished this inspection, he too dropped
below.</p>

<p>“I’d a sight sooner they’d shook their fists at us,” said
Satan. “They know they’ve got us, sure.”</p>

<p>Then Sellers reappeared on the deck, and the <i>Juan</i>
dropped a boat.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” said Jude, “and whether he’s got us or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
whether he hasn’t, he ain’t coming aboard this ship!”</p>

<p>She ran forward and fetched the mop from the hole
where it was stowed.</p>

<p>“Let up!” said Satan. “I don’t want no fightin’: I
tell you, I’ve got a plan; I don’t want no mops in it.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t coming aboard,” said Jude.</p>

<p>As the boat of the <i>Juan</i> came alongside, Sellers, in
the sternsheets, raised his hand in a lordly fashion and
slightly, as befitted a superior taking notice of an inferior.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Satan!” cried Sellers as the bow oar hooked
on.</p>

<p>“Hullo, yourself!” replied Satan. “What you doin’
down here away?”</p>

<p>“Tell you when I get aboard,” said Sellers. “Why,
there’s the kid! Hullo, Kid!”</p>

<p>“Claws off!” cried Jude. “You try to come aboard
and I’ll land you with this mop! You can talk from
the boat.”</p>

<p>Sellers sat down again in the sternsheets.</p>

<p>“She won’t let you aboard,” said Satan, speaking as
though Jude were not present. “You shouldn’t have
sassed her the way you did over there at Lone.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I beg your pardon,” said Sellers. “I’m
trooly sorry to have trod on a female’s sussuptibilities;
but what I’m wishin’ to say is this, and it’s as easy said
from here as on deck: You’ve got to come aboard the
<i>Juan</i>, you and that thousand dollars you’ve had from
Cark, to say nothin’ of the coin you’ve had from Cleary,
an’ be tried by C’t Martial, an’ take your sentence. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
you don’t, I’ll board you, me and Cleary, an’ go through
your ship, an’ fling the lot of you in the lagoon—d’you
take me? I’m not funnin’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said Satan. “I want to have a talk with
Cark anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And he wants to have a talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Right. Off you go, and I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>“Swab!” said Jude, “are you going to pay them that
thousand dollars back? I’d sooner chuck it in the lagoon!”</p>

<p>“I’d pay a thousand dollars to see Cark done in the
eye,” replied Satan. “Where’s the damage? I’ve hived
more than two thousand dollars’ worth of stuff off that
blistered derelic’. You leave them cusses to me.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> they watched Sellers pulling back they saw the
<i>Juan</i> drop a boat.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Satan.</p>

<p>He put the glass to his eye.</p>

<p>“Cark’s coming off. He’s in the sternsheets, him and
his patch—what’s up now?”</p>

<p>The two boats approached one another, and then hung
together, evidently in consultation. Then the oars took
the water and they approached the <i>Sarah</i>, Sellers leading.
Satan, who had found a piece of chewing-gum in
his pocket, put it into his mouth and began to chew,
leisurely, like a cow on her cud, while he watched the
approaching boats.</p>

<p>“What you want?” shouted Satan when they were in
speaking distance.</p>

<p>“Cark says you’re to come aboard right now,” replied
Sellers. “You’ve played him one trick, and he don’t
want you to play him another.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t he?”</p>

<p>“No, he don’t.”</p>

<p>Satan spat into the water alongside and leaned comfortably
on the rail. Carquinez was as close to the <i>Sarah</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
as Sellers, yet he spoke no word, leaving his deputy to
do the talking, and contenting himself with making occasional
birdlike noises.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, ruffled, for all his appearances of
calm, “you can tell him I’ll come when I want to, and
that won’t be before tomorrow morning, for his damn
cheek! Ahoy there, Cark! Ain’t you got a tongue in
your head?”</p>

<p>“He’s like a blessed canary bird,” cut in Jude. “Hi,
there, Sellers! what you done with the cage?”</p>

<p>“Is that your ultermatum?” demanded Sellers, ignoring
Jude and addressing Satan.</p>

<p>“My which matum?”</p>

<p>“Is that all you gotta say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, no!” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Well, then, out with it!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe had never seen Satan “het up” till now, as,
straightening himself and gripping the rail, he let out:</p>

<p>“Gotta say? Why, if I’m sayin’ from now to the
end o’ next week, I couldn’t say the beginnin’ of my
opinion of you, right from the truck of Cleary’s old cod
boat to the keel o’ that old disgrace you ripped of her
guts when she was a yacht—you an’ your crew of cockroaches
an’ dagoes—right from the soles of Cleary’s flat
feet to the end of your bottle nose—you and your ultermatum!</p>

<p>“That’s all. I haven’t time to be wastin’ on you.
I’ll come if I have a mind to and when I want, without
waitin’ for your orders—now scatter yourselves!”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Sellers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
He gave an order to the boat’s crew, and the boat
turned, and, followed by Carquinez, made back to the
<i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p>Satan, his hand on the rail, watched them, still
chewing.</p>

<p>Not a word spoke he, the bulge in his cheek steadfast
against the skyline and his eyes fixed on the boats.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly turned.</p>

<p>“Them thugs will try to board us now,” said Satan.
“We’ve gotta fight. There’s Cleary puttin’ off, and we’ll
have the whole Noah’s ark on us in two ticks. We’ve
gotta get the ammunition ready.”</p>

<p>“There are guns down below,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Guns!” said Satan. “God bless you, we don’t want
no guns! Cark’s too frightened of the law to let any
of his men use knives or pistols. Jude, where’s that
tub of stinkin’ bait—you haven’t hove it over, have you?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Cart it along. Rat; fetch up them five bottles of
whisky,—they’re better’n bumshells,—and there’s an old
fryin’ pan in the galley with a hole in it. Fetch it with
the rest. There’s nothin’ like a fryin’ pan for beltin’
people—you can’t miss. What you gettin’ at Jude?”</p>

<p>“The mop,” said Jude. “I don’t want nothing better
for sweepin’ up rubbish!”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe; but they’ll fight better’n you think.
Lord! if I only had a roll of barb wire! Here they
come! Hurry up, Rat!”</p>

<p>The three boats, Sellers and Cleary leading, were in
motion and making for the <i>Juan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
“We’ve only two to reckon with,” said Satan, as Ratcliffe
arrived, Jude helping him up with the ammunition.
“Cark won’t join in: he’s too frightened of his
skin. Now then, ready with your weapons!”</p>

<p>He was right. Cark’s boat, half a cable-length away,
backed water while the redoubtable Cleary and Sellers
rushed like hawks on the prey, aiming to board the
<i>Sarah</i> to starboard, Cleary forward, Sellers aft.</p>

<p>But the men at the oars were not used to this sort
of work. In their enthusiasm and despite the curses of
their captains, they held on too long, nearly smashed
the boat’s bows against the side of the <i>Sarah</i>, and fell
into wild confusion trying to get their oars in under
the bombardment from the deck. Over the clamor of
the gulls rose the shrill curses and shouts of the dagoes,
the whooping of Satan, the smashing of bottles, while
over all the perfume of bad fish and poisonous whisky
rose like the fume of the fight; but the attackers held,
held by teeth and claws and boathooks, while the wily
Carquinez, on the fringe of the fight, voiceful for once,
standing up and clutching his coat together, shouted directions—unheeded
as unheard.</p>

<p>Twice Sellers was almost on board, and twice Jude’s
mop sent him head over heels back; but now Cleary had
made good forward, backed by two of his crew, and
while Jude, rushing to Ratcliffe’s aid, drove him back
with the mop in the pit of his stomach, Sellers, eyes
shut, head down, and fighting Satan like a mad bull,
gained the deck, gripped Satan, slipped, fell, and rolled
with him in the scuppers. Three dagoes had followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Sellers and flung themselves like dogs on the stragglers;
but now Jude and Ratcliffe, free for a moment, flung
themselves on the dagoes, broke the fight, freed Satan,
and sent the whole lot bundling over, Sellers and all—only
to find that Cleary had made good again, and after
Cleary half his boat’s crew.</p>

<p>Led by Satan, who had seized the frying pan, the defenders
hurled themselves on Cleary.</p>

<p>Satan was right, you can’t miss with a frying pan.
Cleary went down before it. Ratcliffe, using only his
fists, had floored the biggest of the dagoes, and the rest
were crowding back helter skelter, when a shout from
Sellers, who had regained the deck, brought the battle
to a pause.</p>

<p>“Stop fightin’, you damn fools!” cried Sellers.</p>

<p>“Lord! Look!” cried Jude.</p>

<p>The port side of the <i>Sarah</i> was turned to the entrance
of the lagoon, and into the lagoon was gliding a long,
lean destroyer, shearing the blue-green water from her
fore foot.</p>

<p>Being to starboard, the attackers had not seen her,
and the men on deck had been too busy.</p>

<p>Carquinez alone had sighted her. The effect was
magical. Peace fell like a suddenly dropped dish-cover,
and over the rail came Carquinez and half a dozen more
Spaniards from the boats.</p>

<p>“Now we’re done!” said Sellers. “She’s a Britisher,
and this damn sandbank’s British and we’ll be had to
the Bahamas Courts o’ Inquiry and Lord knows what
all. Referred to Havana for inquiries. They’ve seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
us at it, no use in denyin’ it. Look at them cusses’ bloody
noses and Cleary flattened out. Kick him alive, some
of you fools! Here they come!”</p>

<p>The destroyer had cast anchor and dropped a boat.
With the terrible precision of a hawk or a warship
closing on its prey, she was on to the <i>Sarah</i>. A blue
and gold man held the yoke lines, and the oars of the
rowers rowed like one.</p>

<p>“Look at that image on the sternsheets,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>“Leave him to me,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“What’s your game?”</p>

<p>“Shut your head! Here he is!”</p>

<p>The boat came alongside. The oars rising like one,
fell with a crash, the bow oar hooked on, and over the
rail came a sublieutenant of the British Navy, smooth
of face and neat as though just taken from a bandbox.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you fellows up to, fighting here?”
asked the sublieutenant.</p>

<p>Satan broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“We’re movie men,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“You’re what?”</p>

<p>“Movin’ pictures.”</p>

<p>“Oh—cinematograph?”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, fired with admiration for this Satanic move,
joined in laughing.</p>

<p>“Did you think we were fighting, really? Well, that’s
funny. What’s the name of your ship?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Albatross</i>,” replied the sublieutenant, completely
and roundly taken in. “You’re English, aren’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
“Yes, I’m English. Joined the show some time ago.”</p>

<p>“What’s that hooker on the sand over there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s part of our show. Boat supposed to have
been wrecked—these chaps are pirates.”</p>

<p>“Jolly good make-up!” said the other, surveying the
pirates and taking in Cark, also Cleary, who, resuscitated
in time, was leaning over the rail chewing and
spitting into the water.</p>

<p>The awful question, “Where’s your camera?” never
came. If it had, Satan would no doubt have met it;
but the sublieutenant was new to this sort of business
and not on the hunt for evidence. The thing was palpable
and plain. No complaint came from the attacked,
and attacked and attackers were all seemingly friends.
The words “cinematograph company” covered the situation
completely.</p>

<p>He gave a few words of information about the
<i>Albatross</i>. She had put in for a small repair and would
be off again tomorrow morning. Then he dropped into
his boat and the incident was closed.</p>

<p>“Now, you cusses,” said Satan, “see where you have
landed yourselves! Where’d you have been only for
me?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t deny you slipped the hood over that
Britisher pretty smart,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>Cleary turned his head and looked at Sellers. “<em>You</em>
don’t deny! Why, you bloody barnacle scraper, I told
you to hold off from the business! Satan, I forgive
you that clap on the head. Lord love me! I’ll never
carry a derringer again. Give me a fryin’ pan, that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the weppin; you can’t dodge it no more than you can
dodge a thunderstorm.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Satan, “fryin’ pan back the lot of you,
and I’ll be on board the <i>Juan</i> inside half an hour and
settle my business with you. If Cark had kept his mouth
shut instead of givin’ me orders, we’d have finished it
by now and no heads broke.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be waiting for you,” said Sellers.</p>

<p>They tumbled into the boats and rowed off.</p>

<p>“They never drew a knife,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cark took their knives from them,” said Satan.
“He didn’t want no blood spillin’ and trouble,—too much
afraid of the law.”</p>

<p>Jude, who had collapsed sitting-wise on the deck, began
to laugh hysterically.</p>

<p>“What are you laughin’ at?” demanded Satan.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Jude.</p>

<span class="subhead">“I’LL TAK!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Ten</span> minutes later Satan and Ratcliffe boarded the
<i>Juan</i>. Cleary was already on board, down in the
cabin with the others; Cark and a bottle of gin were
presiding at one end of the table. Satan, with a nod
to the company, came to the table and took his seat;
motioning Ratcliffe to take the seat opposite to him.</p>

<p>It was like a meeting of a board of directors, and
the table just held the six comfortably.</p>

<p>What followed struck the unaccustomed Ratcliffe with
astonishment,—the amiability of it,—it might have been
a card party, with Satan the loser—momentarily.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” said Satan, “what’s to pay?”</p>

<p>There were extra glasses on the table and a box of
cigars. The cigars were pushed along by Sellers as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“There’s Cark’s loss of time,” said Sellers, “not to
say mine and Cleary’s. We tried for you round Rum
Cay when you gave us the slip, and then there was the
run down here. A thousand dollars to us that means,
and five hundred to Cleary.”</p>

<p>“Makin’ it two thousand five hundred and forty,” said
Satan. “I’m agreeable—and the derelic’ is mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
“Which derelic’?” asked Sellers innocently.</p>

<p>Satan, absolutely disdaining to reply, lit a cigar.</p>

<p>“She’s worth all ten thousand dollars,” said he, “and
what’s the salvage on that?”</p>

<p>“Y’mean that old dismasted catboat stuck on the sand
there?” said Cleary. “Not worth five—b’sides she’s our
meat.”</p>

<p>Satan dropped Sellers and turned to Carquinez.
“You’ll maybe explain,” said he. “You know the rights
of the law. If you try to collar that hooker, I’ll come
in with first claim, and here’s a gentleman will back me
in law expenses. You know him,—Mr. Ratcliffe, Holt
&amp; Ratcliffe.”</p>

<p>“I’ll back you,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“And it seems to me law is not your lay, Cark,” went
on Satan. “We came in here yesterday and boarded
and claimed that hooker, and I was fixing the tackle
for towing when you blew along. The thing’s as
clear as paint. She’s ours for salvage, and you’re not
in it.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” began Sellers violently—then he closed
up: Cark had given him a kick under the table. Then
there was silence for a moment, during which these two
scoundrels seemed to brood together telepathically.</p>

<p>Then Cark spoke, addressing Satan.</p>

<p>“Will you take the air on deck for wan moment with
your friend?” said Cark.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Satan.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were called down again.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Sellers, acting as spokesman for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
others, “we don’t want to bear hard on you, but we’ve
been at a big loss over this business.”</p>

<p>“And who let you in for it?” asked Satan. “Haven’t
you been chasin’ me since last fall over the <i>Nombre</i>?
Was it my fault she weren’t there?”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow we’re losers. But I’m coming to the
derelic’. You’ll never be able to do the tow with the
<i>Sarah</i>—why, the <i>Sarah</i> ain’t bigger than her, and you’re
underhanded anyhow.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“Well, what I propose is this,” said Sellers. “We’ll
drop claims for the run down here and only ask a thousand
and forty of you, and you drop claims on the
derelic’.”</p>

<p>Satan laughed.</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t know she’s got an auxiliary in her
worth four thousand dollars if it’s worth a cent. She’s
broke her propeller, but she’s got a spare one on board,
and if I knew anythin’ of injins I’d drive her back on
her own power. No, I sticks to the derelic’ if that’s
the best you can offer and here’s your dollars—though
I’ll have to give you my check for the extra money.”</p>

<p>He produced a bundle; then, with his hand on it:</p>

<p>“If you choose to take the derelic’ for what she’s worth
and call it quits. I’ll trade, one or the other. I’m not
set on that tow. But there you are; you know the
chances.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tak!” suddenly broke in Carquinez, and the business
was ended.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE VANISHED LIGHT</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A week</span> later, toward sundown, the <i>Sarah</i> came up
the half-mile channel and dropped her hook in
Havana Harbor close to the old anchorage of the <i>Maine</i>.
A Royal Mail boat passing out gave her the kick of its
wash as she settled down to her moorings, a customs
boat dropped alongside, and the customs men, hailing
Satan as a friend and brother, came aboard and transacted
business with him in the cabin. The wind blew
warm, bringing scents and sounds across the vast harbor,
fluttering the flags of the shipping, and Ratcliffe,
standing at the rail, dazzled by the brilliance of the
scene before him, knew that his cruise was over.</p>

<p>It was like coming to the end of a book,—a volume
suddenly handed to him by Fate to read, and of which
he was condemned to write the sequel.</p>

<p>He remembered the morning at Palm Island when
he boarded the <i>Sarah</i> first, and the picture was still fresh
in his mind of the <i>Haliotis</i> as they had left her in the
lagoon at Cormorant, Sellers and Cleary and their men
swarming about her and tinkering her up. They intended
to ship the spare propeller and bring her along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
under her own motive power to the nearest port, Nassau
in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>They had been so busy with the engines and the hull
that they had never noticed how completely she had
been stripped. They were unconscious of the fact that
she had been left with her anchor down—unfortunates!
He could still see them like ants laboring in the sun, at
the task set to them by the grimly humorous Satan.</p>

<p>Satan had won the game they had forced on him,
holding, as he did, a thousand and forty dollars, the
“tripes” of the <i>Haliotis</i>, and the secret of the mug trap,
to be disposed of, perhaps, later on for a consideration.
Satan would, no doubt, set other unfortunates digging
for the <i>Nombre</i> just as he had set Cleary and Sellers
tinkering and towing at the <i>Haliotis</i>, just as he had held
up freighters for a bunch of bananas, just as he had
made Thelusson and his crew careen and scrape the
<i>Sarah</i>, just as he had made Ratcliffe an accomplice in
his plans and a handy man to help him in his works;
yet the funny thing about the scamp was the fact that
he was absolutely dependable, when not dealing with
companies or governments or derelicts. Ratcliffe would
have trusted him with his last penny.</p>

<p>Dependable if you took hold of him by his handle and
not by his cutting edge! Trustable if you trusted him!</p>

<p>Then Jude came up in her harbor rig; that is to say,
boots and a coat.</p>

<p>“Satan’s clacking away with the customs an’ the port
doctor man,” said Jude. “You can’t see across the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
with the smoke, and I had to change my rig in the
galley.”</p>

<p>“You going ashore?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jude, “Satan’s going. I’ve got to keep
ship. You going with him?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>Appeared Satan, followed by the port men, who tumbled
into the boat and rowed off.</p>

<p>“Goin’ ashore?” asked Satan. “Well, I’ll row you to
the wharf after I’ve had a bite of supper. Jude’ll bring
the boat back, and we can get a shore boat off for half
a dollar.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, just as the electrics were springing
alive and the anchor lights of the shipping marking the
dusk blue sky, they started. They stood on the wharf
steps for a moment watching Jude row off, then they
turned to the town.</p>

<p>Havana smells different from any other seaport. She
smells of rum and garlic and dirt and cigars and the
earth of Cuba, which is different from the earth anywhere
else. The harbor and the town exchange bouquets;
the negroes help; Spanish cigarettes, Florida water
and decaying vegetables lend a hand. Satan led the
way. He knew the place as well as the inside of his
pocket, and as he trudged along beside Ratcliffe under
the electrics across plazas, or through short-cut cut-throat-looking
byways, he pointed out the notable features
of the place,—Dutch Pete’s, the Alvarez factory,
the great opera house, the Calle Commacio, the cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
They passed Florion’s with its marble tables, drinkers,
and domino players, and Satan suddenly hove to.</p>

<p>“Where d’you want to go now?” said Satan. “D’you
want drinks?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want drinks,” said Ratcliffe. “Come over
here.”</p>

<p>A blazing cinema palace shone across the way, and
they entered, Ratcliffe paying.</p>

<p>The place was in black darkness. A cowboy shooting
up a bar was on the screen, and a man with an electric
torch led them to their seats.</p>

<p>Then they sat watching the pictures, Satan criticizing
the actors sometimes, and in a loud voice and not always
favorably. The cowboy shot himself off the screen, the
lights flared up for half a minute, went out, and the
pictures resumed.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe felt a nudge, and in the darkness Satan’s
voice, muted now, came in his ear.</p>

<p>“Say,” whispered Satan, “did you see him?”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The man that dropped you at Pa’m Island.”</p>

<p>“Skelton!”</p>

<p>“That’s him. He’s sittin’ right a front of you.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Sure as sure.”</p>

<p>Skelton here! But where, then, was the <i>Dryad</i>? Had
he wrecked her, or what?</p>

<p>The words of Satan seemed to alter everything, from
the music to the picture of John Bunny on the screen.</p>

<p>The darkness, filled with native Havana scents, became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
tinged with the atmosphere of British Respectability.
Skelton at the pictures! Why, he ought to have been
at the opera or one of the theaters or walking on the
<i>alameda</i> digesting his dinner and thinking of Tariff
Reform or Anglicanism. It seemed impossible; yet
when the light flared up again there was Skelton, sure
enough, sitting with another man, and now he was rising,
evidently tired of the show, and passing out, followed
by his friend, grave as though he had been attending
his mother’s funeral instead of the marriage of John
Bunny to Flora Finch in a Pullman car with negro accompaniments.</p>

<p>He wore evening clothes, covered by a light overcoat.
Ratcliffe rose and, followed by Satan, pursued him,
touching him on the shoulder outside and in the full
blaze of the lamps.</p>

<p>“Good God!” said Skelton. “Ratcliffe!”</p>

<p>“Just got in,” said Ratcliffe. “Had a ripping time.
Where’s the <i>Dryad</i>?”</p>

<p>“Up at the wharf, coaling,” replied Skelton, absorbing
Ratcliffe’s rough and ready garb, the cloth cap he was
wearing, and Satan. “I’m staying at the Matanzas; but
I go aboard tomorrow morning, and we’re off in the
evening. What have you been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, having no end of fun. We found an old treasure
ship and blew her up and found she was full of
skulls and bones. You know Satan?”</p>

<p>Skelton, who had ignored Satan, acknowledged his existence
by a little nod.</p>

<p>“Who’s your friend?” asked Ratcliffe, glancing at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Skelton’s companion, who had removed himself a few
paces.</p>

<p>“Ponsonby—diplomatic service. See here, come on
board to lunch tomorrow—one-fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“I have some gear of yours.”</p>

<p>“Right. I’ll see about it.”</p>

<p>“’Night.”</p>

<p>“’Night.”</p>

<p>Off he went.</p>

<p>They had seen enough of the pictures, and having no
inclination for cafés or taverns or gambling shops they
made back toward the wharves, Satan walking in profound
silence, Ratcliffe thinking.</p>

<p>The whole evening he had been followed by a miserable
sort of half-depression. It had attached itself
to him first on the deck of the <i>Sarah</i>, born of his return
to civilization; it had managed to decolorize the past
few weeks and demagnetize Jude.</p>

<p>His conscious mind had never quite gauged the hold
that Jude had managed to get upon him, and this subconscious
devil, rising at the touch of civilization, like
a gas bubble from his conventional past, had burst, with
spoiling effect, robbing the <i>Sarah</i> of her romance and
sea-charm and the past few weeks of their brightness.
Jude had dimmed with everything else, become part and
parcel of what seemed an illusion.</p>

<p>It was while sitting at the pictures, in black darkness,
with knowledge of Skelton’s presence, that the atmosphere
began to clear, the waves to beat again on Cormorant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Cay, the gulls to fly and call—and Jude come
back to life.</p>

<p>He heard again that queer little laugh of hers as she
removed his hand. He felt again the warm body that
had rested confidingly against him away there on the
sandspit.</p>

<p>And then she was out on the black harbor alone in
the <i>Sarah</i>, while he and Satan were watching the pictures!
Suppose some lumbering sailing craft being
towed to her moorings or some incoming mailboat were
to smash into the <i>Sarah</i>—and they were to row off and
find nothing—no Jude?</p>

<p>The thought almost made him rise from his seat to
leave the place. But he could not explain to Satan;
so he sat on till the lights flared out. And all the time,
mocking the pictures on the screen, came pictures of
Jude, all sunlit, real, fresh as herself!</p>

<p>Then, as they pursued their way to the wharf after
leaving Skelton, the impatience increased; the darkness
of the night, the blaze of the town, the gay life of the
streets, and the revelry of the cafés seemed sinister and
banded in a conspiracy against him and the lonely little
figure of Jude. The indifference of Skelton, the way
he had gone hurriedly off, the way he had ignored
Satan, were part of the business, blended with the blazing
cafés, the moving crowd of Chinks, colored men, Spaniards,
and Americans, the brilliance and gaiety without
heart, that seemed like a barrier between him and the
humble little <i>Sarah</i> and Jude away out there in the darkness
alone—waiting for him! It came to him that Jude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
was the one sole thing he wanted in the cruel, odd,
electric-lit world—and he had left her!</p>

<p>They passed through narrow streets like the streets in
an evil dream and blazing streets hideous with noise.
Then at last they reached the wharf with its amber
lights spilling on the black waving water. Satan hired
a boat, and they put off, two dagoes rowing and Satan
at the yoke-lines.</p>

<p>The <i>Sarah</i> was anchored a mile out, and the vast
three-mile harbor, vague in the starlight and circled by
the hills, seemed to Ratcliffe more immense than when
seen by daylight.</p>

<p>Lights, lights everywhere,—scattered lights of shipping,
some near, some far away, gem-crusted bulks that
were great liners at anchor, songs and voices, and the
creak of the oars in the rowlocks! Then a sudden green,
red, and white light ahead and a fussy and furious little
tug that nearly ran them down and left them rocking
in her wash.</p>

<p>“Scowbankers!” said Satan. Then: “I can’t make
out the light of the <i>Sarah</i>, nohow.”</p>

<p>A clutch came to Ratcliffe’s heart, the clutch of something
cold and malign which had seemed following him
ever since Skelton’s presence had made itself felt like
an evil omen.</p>

<p>They were so far out now that the sounds of the
town and wharves had died to nothing; but still the
creak of the oars in the rowlocks kept on. Then came
Satan’s voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
“That’s her, over beyond them three lights on the
starboard bow.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe breathed again, and his heart leaped in him
as he picked out the light.</p>

<p>Satan altered their course.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“You gave me the devil of a fright.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“I thought she might have been run down by some
ship coming in—or something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s well out of the track,” said Satan.</p>

<p>“All the same, I didn’t feel easy.”</p>

<p>Then they hung silent, Ratcliffe’s eyes on the light and
his hand in his pocket feeling for dollars to pay the
boatmen.</p>

<p>“What’s there to pay?” asked he.</p>

<p>“A dollar, seeing there’s two of them,” replied Satan.
“<i>Sarah</i> ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Ahoy!” came Jude’s voice, and a lantern swung over
the side.</p>

<p>Satan bundled on board, and Ratcliffe crammed five
dollars into the hand of the stern oar; then he followed,
and the fellows pushed off.</p>

<p>“Took it without fightin’!” said Satan. “Lord’s sake,
what’s come to them?” Then he bundled below to make
some coffee.</p>

<p>Jude snuffed the lantern out.</p>

<p>She was moving away from the side and away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Ratcliffe, when he caught hold of her round the body.
She did not resist him. He held her close to his heart.</p>

<p>“Jude!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jude, with a sudden catch in her
breath and speaking in a whisper. “Whacha want?”</p>

<p>Then his lips met hers, full.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Satan, making his coffee over the
Primus stove of the <i>Haliotis</i>, heard a struggling sound,
mixed with stifled laughter, and Ratcliffe appeared at
the cabin door. He was dragging Jude in; she was half-resisting,
and her face was hid in the crook of her arm.</p>

<p>“Satan,” said Ratcliffe, “I’m going to marry Jude.”</p>

<p>“God help you!” said Satan.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WEDDING PRESENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“I’m</span> going to marry Jude!”</p>

<p>The fantastic fact embodied in those words appeared
to him folly only next day at one o’clock, with
the sky to northward breathing hot on Havana Harbor
like the mouth of a blue oven, flags fluttering to the
wind, the drum and fife band of an American training
ship coming over the water, and the <i>Dryad</i> being towed
to her moorings half a mile shoreward.</p>

<p>The blushing bride-to-be of last night, hiding her nose
on Ratcliffe’s shoulder, as they sat together on the couch
before Satan, while he taunted her with the fact that
now she’d have to get into skirts, had turned back into
Jude.</p>

<p>She was busy getting the dinghy ready to row her
fiancé off to the <i>Dryad</i>.</p>

<p>She was over the side in her, busy and humming a
tune as she worked, baling out water, fixing the cushions,
and so on, while Satan watched her in a brooding manner
over the rail.</p>

<p>A ghastly fear was working in the heart of Satan,
the fear that Skelton might want the dinghy returned.</p>

<p>“Now, mind you,” said Satan, “and bring the boat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
back. I’d sooner lose me head than that boat. If you
come back without her, I’ll chuck you in the harbor!
I’m talking straight.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, who had just come on deck dressed for the
occasion, came to the rail. Jude looked up at him and
laughed.</p>

<p>He had seen her laughing before, he had seen her
surly, meditative, brooding, weeping, flushed with anger,
grumbling; but he had never seen her with a look like
this,—happy.</p>

<p>Since last night something had come into her eyes that
made her, when her eyes met his, beautiful. It was as
though a lamp had been suddenly lit inside her, and
the magical thing was the knowledge that he himself was
the lamplighter.</p>

<p>He had created this new something that spoke to him
right out, right to his heart, right to his soul!</p>

<p>He got into the dinghy, nodded to Satan, and they
started, Jude at the sculls, her trousers rolled half-way
up to the knees and her old panama on the back of her
head.</p>

<p>“Go slow,” said he, “there’s lots of time.” Then,
when they were out of hearing and he was alone with
her at last:</p>

<p>“Jude!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“D’you remember yesterday you asked me if I was
going away, now the anchor was down?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What would you have done if I had?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
“I’d a drowned myself in the harbor,” said Jude without
a moment’s hesitation. “What’s the good of asking?”</p>

<p>“When did you begin to care for me a bit?”</p>

<p>“D’you remember the sandspit?” asked Jude. “I dunno—maybe
it was beyond then—remember the cache?”</p>

<p>“When I chased you round the tree and—”</p>

<p>Jude screwed up her lips.</p>

<p>“You gave me an awful bang on the head.”</p>

<p>“You frightened the gizzard out of me,” said Jude,
“and I wasn’t the same after—that night.”</p>

<p>“I remember, I heard you telling Satan that hants
were chasing you.”</p>

<p>“You were the hants.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t care for me then. Remember you
said derricks were only good for hoisting fools off ships
with.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it was a sort of caring turned inside out,”
said Jude. She turned her head to see if they were making
for the <i>Dryad</i>.</p>

<p>“You’re letting her off her course,” said she, “unless
you’re making for that brig.”</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon make for her as anywhere else,”
said he, altering the course, “unless it was the sandspit—Jude!”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Imagine if we were alone on the sandspit, you and I,
just as we were that day, instead of in this rotten old
harbor—let’s go there!”</p>

<p>“I’m willing.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
“Soon’s you like.”</p>

<p>“We can get a tent and grub, and Satan can take us
there and come back for us. Damn! here’s the <i>Dryad</i>!”</p>

<p>The first officer of the <i>Dryad</i> was leaning over the rail
watching them. The stage was down, and Jude brought
the dinghy alongside.</p>

<p>Then on the stage he watched her rowing off. He
waved his hand to her, and she replied.</p>

<p>Then, when he reached the deck, he found Skelton
also at the rail.</p>

<p>“’Morning,” said Ratcliffe. “That’s Satan’s sister.”</p>

<p>“Which?” asked Skelton. “That—er—person in the
boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But you saw her on deck down at Palm Island,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten,” said Skelton, dismissing the subject.</p>

<p>There were no guests. Ponsonby was to have come,
but he was indisposed; yet the luncheon was just as
formal an affair as though a dozen had been present
instead of two.</p>

<p>Half-way through the meal, however, Ratcliffe’s spirits
began to brighten under the influence of Perrier Jouet
and the harlequin thought that began to dance in his
head, “I am going for a honeymoon to the sandspit
with Jude!”</p>

<p>He laughed occasionally at nothing in particular, and
Skelton thought his manner strange, heady, queer, and
began to thank his stars that Ponsonby was indisposed.
He noticed also that Ratcliffe’s hands, despite scrubbing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
bore the evidence of hard work not dissociated with tar.
There was also something queer about his hair.</p>

<p>There was! Satan had barbarized it down at Cormorant
with the pair of scissors he used on Jude.</p>

<p>Skelton, in asking Ratcliffe on board to luncheon, had
considered himself a most forgiving individual. Leaving
aside their little quarrel at Palm Island, remained
the fact that Ratcliffe had left his ship, deserted him for
the company of those Yankee “scowbankers,” and, to
make matters worse, Ratcliffe seemed to have enjoyed
the exchange.</p>

<p>Now, in closer company with the delinquent, he was
beginning to regret his forgiveness. “The man had deteriorated!”</p>

<p>As a result of this impression his manner had stiffened;
he felt irritated and bored.</p>

<p>The steward had withdrawn, having placed the dessert
on the table, and Skelton was in the act of carving a
pineapple in the only way a pineapple ought to be carved,—that
is to say by tearing it into pieces with two forks,—when
Ratcliffe, who had been staring at the fruit as
though hypnotized, suddenly broke into a chuckle of
laughter.</p>

<p>The pineapple, connecting itself, maybe, with canned
pineapples robbed from the store room of the <i>Haliotis</i>,
had suddenly brought up the vision of Satan.</p>

<p>Satan in a new guise—Satan as a matchmaker!</p>

<p>All sorts of things, some almost half-forgotten, rushed
together to clothe Satan in this new garment. He remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Satan’s solicitude for Jude’s future, Satan’s
complacency when he and Jude had gone off to the sandspit
together, his conversations about Jude, the complete
absence of surprise with which he had taken the business
of last night,—a hundred things, and all pointing
in the same direction and to the fact that Satan had
wished the business, just as he had wished the dinghy
away from Skelton, just as he had wished Ratcliffe on
board of the <i>Sarah Tyler</i>.</p>

<p>He, Ratcliffe, was part of the sea-pickings of this
gipsy, part and parcel with bunches of bananas, pots
of paint, sailcloth, mainsheet buffers, cringles, and so
on! He was annexed to fit Jude just as the mast-winch
of the <i>Haliotis</i> was annexed to fit the <i>Sarah</i>!</p>

<p>Jude herself had declared that Satan had brought him
on board because he “wanted him.”</p>

<p>Skelton paused in his operation on the pineapple and
stared at the other.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Ratcliffe, “but something
has just struck me so horribly funny I couldn’t help
laughing—anyhow, the joke is against myself. Look
here, Skelton, I want to tell you something—I’m—m—going
to marry a girl.”</p>

<p>“Indeed—but what is there horribly funny about that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—it’s not that, it’s something else; but let’s
start with that. I’m going to marry that girl who rowed
me over here today, Satan’s sister.”</p>

<p>Skelton laid down his fork. All his starch had vanished.
Surprised out of his life, he seemed suddenly to
grow younger and more natural looking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
“Good God!” said Skelton, staring at the other. “You
don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“I do. I don’t know why I am telling you, but there
it is. You can’t understand in the least—couldn’t hope
to make you.”</p>

<p>Now Skelton with his starch off and in an emergency
was a sound man, with a heart as good as any ordinary
mortal’s.</p>

<p>He had an eye that no little detail ever escaped. He
had seen Jude at Palm Island, he had heard her speak,
he had seen her half an hour ago, and Ratcliffe’s manner
left him in no doubt as to his absolute earnestness.</p>

<p>The man was about to commit suicide, social suicide.
He had seen men do the same thing often in different
ways.</p>

<p>He pushed the pineapple away and rose from the
table.</p>

<p>“Come into the smoke room,” said he.</p>

<p>In the smoke room he rang for coffee. Not a word
about Jude. Dead silence.</p>

<p>Then, when the coffee was brought and the door closed,
he turned to the other.</p>

<p>“Ratcliffe, you can’t do this thing. I know. Let me
speak for a moment. You are your own master, free
to do as you choose; but I must speak. I like you.
Our temperaments are dead different, and we don’t make
good companions; but you have many sterling qualities,
and I don’t want to see you come a mucker. You can
do a thing like this in two minutes; but two hundred
years won’t get you out of it, once it’s done. (Take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
sugar in your coffee? Yes, I remember.) See here!
I had a young brother once who was going to do just
the same,—absolutely ruin himself. I managed to stop
it, saved his future and his name.”</p>

<p>He picked a cigar out of a box and, coming to a dead
stop in his remarks, cut the end off.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said Ratcliffe, before he could continue,
“I know absolutely and exactly how you feel on
the subject and what you would say. I’ve felt it myself
and said it to myself.</p>

<p>“I began to get fond of her almost from the first.
If you’d been in my shoes, you would have been just
the same. No one could help getting fond of her. Then
after awhile I found how I was drifting, and I said to
myself, ‘It’s absurd!’ I pictured all my female relations
and so forth and my position in the wonderful thing
you call Society.”</p>

<p>“Don’t sneer at Society,” said Skelton gravely. “That’s
the easiest sort of cant that ever folly put into a man’s
mouth. Go on.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Ratcliffe. “All the same Society
galls one at times when the thought of it comes up
against something alive and fresh and free from snobbery
like Jude. Well, things went on and on. I hadn’t
much time for thinking, underhanded as we were; and
that was the fatal thing, for I absorbed her without
thinking,—not her face or body, but her character. You
know that, underhanded and close together on a tub like
the <i>Sarah</i>, character is the thing that shows and counts,
and at every hand’s turn hers showed up and got a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
tighter grip on me. It wasn’t a character all jam, either,
but it was a thing to count on and real as the sea—you
can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Skelton, humoring the other, “a fine
character.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, no!” said Ratcliffe. “Don’t get away with
things. <em>Real</em>, that’s the word!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear man—”</p>

<p>“I know what you are going to say. She can’t speak
King’s English—well, I’m going to teach her. She’s
dressed like that—well, I’m going to dress her properly
after awhile.”</p>

<p>Skelton suddenly showed a flash of irritation.</p>

<p>“Come up to the point,” said he. “Are you, after
what I’ve said, still fixed in your purpose? Are you
going to marry her?”</p>

<p>“As soon as ever I can get a priest off to the old
<i>Sarah</i>,” replied Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“That is your last word?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Skelton. His manner changed. He
had done what he could: it was useless. Ratcliffe was
no relation of his, and now, contemplating the thing
with as much detachment as though it were a losing
horse race or boxing encounter on which he had no bet,
he lit the cigar, which he had been holding unlighted
in his fingers, and became almost amiable.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he, “go ahead. After all, it’s not
my affair; but I’ll be interested to know how you get
on. By the way, I have some gear of yours on board.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
“Take it back, will you, like a good chap,” said the
other, “and leave it with the yacht people at Southampton?
I’ll pick it up there when I return.”</p>

<p>“You are coming back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather; but not for a year or so, maybe. I’ve
a lot to do, and when you see us next maybe you’ll
agree—” He stopped short and relit his cigar, and they
hung silent, each engaged in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Now; on the warm sea-scented air entering through
the open ports, came a voice.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the second officer, addressing someone
over-side.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Bring her round to the quarter-boat
davits; she’s to come aboard.”</p>

<p>“That’s the dinghy,” said Skelton. “I told them to
bring her aboard. I’ll send you back in the pinnace.”</p>

<p>Again came the voice.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Are you deaf? Bring her round to the
quarter-boat davits; she’s to come aboard.”</p>

<p>Then Jude’s fresh young voice:</p>

<p>“Gar’n! She’s ours; old Popplecock gave her to
Satan. Whacha talking about?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” came the other’s. “You wait till Sir
William comes on deck.”</p>

<p>Skelton with a grim smile turned to the door. He
pointed to the clock on the bulkhead.</p>

<p>“I’m going on deck,” said he. “See that clock—promise
me to stick here for two minutes by it and
think right over the matter for the last time. Don’t let
anything I have said weigh with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
He went on deck and, keeping clear of the rail, entered
into conversation with the first officer.</p>

<p>Three minutes passed, and Ratcliffe’s head appeared at
the saloon hatch.</p>

<p>“Going?” said Skelton.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Right! You can keep the dinghy—it’s a wedding
present. Luck!”</p>

<p>“Same to you!” said Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>He gripped the other’s hand, and the grip was returned.
The two men had never been so close to each
other before, never would be again.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Two hours later the <i>Dryad</i>, queening it over the satin-smooth
harbor, dipped her flag to the humble little
<i>Sarah</i>, and the <i>Sarah</i> dipped her flag to the <i>Dryad</i>, and
someone in the Wedding Present lying alongside the
<i>Sarah</i> waved a hat.</p>

<p>Skelton, at the after rail, fixed his binoculars on the
hat-waver. It was Satan.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
